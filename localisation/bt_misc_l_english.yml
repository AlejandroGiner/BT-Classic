 beer:0 "Beer"
 beerDESC:0 "Beer and other cereal alcohols such as whisky or rice wine have been produced for many thousands of years all around the world and represent a significant part of the daily diet for most cultures. While sometimes disdained in favor of wine or fruit-based alcohols in warmer climes, it is often cheaper, faster, and easier to produce, especially in regions where grapes cannot be easily cultivated."
 books:0 "Books"
 booksDESC:0 "Books, including everything from Bibles and Qurans to scientific treatises, from to poetry and prose to historical texts, evolved into a floruishing business during the late medieval and early modern periods. Rare vellum manuscripts could be worth many times their weight in gold, while printed books spread literacy and ideas in ways that changed the world."
 whales:0 "Whaling"
 whalesDESC:0 "Whaling is the hunting of whales for their usable products such as meat and blubber, which can be turned into a type of oil which became increasingly important in the Industrial Revolution. It was practiced as an organized industry as early as 875 AD. By the 16th century, the industry spread throughout the world, and became increasingly profitable in terms of trade and resources, from the coastal areas of Europe to remote islands in the sub-Antarctic."
 rice:0 "Rice"
 riceDESC:0 "Rice is a staple crop that has been cultivated by humans for millennia. Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. Rice was hence a fundamental part of the economy of most Asian nations, but it has been cultivated in other places such as Europe or Africa just as well."
 potatoes:0 "Potatoes"
 potatoesDESC:0 "The Potato is a starchy crop with a long history of cultivation in South America. Following the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, the Spanish introduced the potato to Europe in the second half of the 16th century, part of the Columbian exchange. Soon enough it became an important food staple and field crop that played a major role in the European 19th century population boom. In the 19th century, however, a plant disease known as late blight spread rapidly through the poorer communities of the western British Isles, resulting in the crop failures that led to the Great Irish Famine."
 maize:0 "Maize"
 maizeDESC:0 "Maize, also known as Corn, is a grain crop cultivated in the valleys of Mexico since ancient times. Later, maize spread from this region over the Americas along two major paths, and after the arrival of Europeans in 1492, Spanish settlers consumed maize and explorers and traders carried it back to Europe and introduced it to other countries. Maize thus became an important crop for human and livestock consumption alike."
 millet:0 "Millet"
 milletDESC:0 "Millets are a group of highly variable small-seeded grasses, widely grown around the world as cereal crops or grains for fodder and human food. Millets are especially important crops in the semiarid tropics of Asia and Africa, favored due to their productivity and short growing season under dry, high-temperature conditions."
 apiculture:0 "Apiculture"
 apicultureDESC:0 "Apiculture refers to the maintenance of bee colonies, commonly in man-made hives, by humans. This ancient practice is carried out in order to collect the bees' honey and other products that their hive produce (including beeswax, propolis, flower pollen, bee pollen, and royal jelly), or to pollinate crops."
 fruit:0 "Fruit"
 fruitDESC:0 "Fruits are the sweet and fleshy products of a tree or other plant that contain seed and can be eaten as food. Fruits have been among the earliest types of food consumed by humans since hunter-gatherer societies, and the plethora of fruit types available worldwide ensures their continuous presence in all types of human societies. Fruit types can grow almost anywhere, but are especially common in forests and tropical areas."
 olives:0 "Olives"
 olivesDESC:0 "Olive trees are of major agricultural importance in the Mediterranean region as the source of olive oil. The use of olive oil dates back to ancient times and remains a fundamental part of the economy and cuisine of most of the Mediterranean population, as well as becoming widespread in other parts of the world thanks to colonization."
 dates:0 "Dates"
 datesDESC:0 "Dates, a flowering plant species part of the Arecaceae palm family, have been a staple food of the Middle East and the Indus Valley for thousands of years. Also well known for being odorless, Date production thrived in Oasis environments, as not only a stable food source, but also as a tasty export that foreigners are eager to trade for."
 marble:0 "Marble"
 marbleDESC:0 "Notorious due to its crystalline composition, a wide variety of types of stone and marble have played an enormous role in the construction of buildings and statuary through history in countries around the world. White marble has been prized for its use in sculptures since classical times while dimension stone has been widely used for construction."
 oil:0 "Oil"
 oilDESC:0 "Though known since ancient times, oil didn't become useful until proper refinement methods were invented in late 19th century. Since then oil has become the most important fuel of modern world and a factor in several military conflicts."
 rubber:0 "Rubber"
 rubberDESC:0 "Natural rubber, also called caoutchouc, is harvested mainly in the form of the latex from the rubber tree or others. The latex is a sticky, milky colloid drawn off by making incisions in the bark and collecting the fluid in vessels in a process called tapping."
 amaranth:0 "Amaranth"
 amaranthDESC:0 "Amaranth is a family of plants that has a long history of cultivation in the southern Americas, and was cultivated on a large scale in ancient Mexico, Guatemala, and Peru. There are multiple plants in this category of which perhaps the best known is Quinoa. Known to the Aztecs as huauhtli, and to the Incas as chisoya mama or "mother of all grains", and it was the Inca emperor who would traditionally sow the first seeds of the season using "golden implements". Though not popular outside of the Americas during the age of colonization, Quinoa and related plants were a staple of native agriculture and remained a fundamental crop in the region."
 legumes:0 "Legumes"
 legumesDESC:0 "Legumes come from related species of plants which produce important crops such as beans, peas, lentils, fava beans, peanuts and many others. Cultivation of legumes has an ancient history and was widespread in the Old and New Worlds alike. While lentils and fava beans were prevalent in the old world, others such as beans were introduced to Europe after colonization."
 teff:0 "Teff"
 teffDESC:0 "Teff is an annual grass originating from the Horn of Africa, where it is cultivated for its edible seeds. Endemic to this part of the world, Teff has formed the backbone of the agricultural production of the Ethiopian kingdoms and empires since time immemorial. The name teff is thought to originate from the Amharic word teffa, which means 'lost'. This probably refers to its tiny seeds, which have a diameter smaller than 1 mm. Teff is quite adaptive and can grow in various environmental conditions; particularly, teff can be cultivated in dry environments, but also under wet conditions on marginal soils."
 pearls: "Pearls"
 pearlsDESC: "Pearls are hard, glistening objects produced within the mantle of a living shelled mollusk. The finest quality of natural pearls have been highly valued as gemstones and objects of beauty for many centuries. For thousands of years, seawater pearls were retrieved by divers in a dangerous, yet very profitable job, as these luxurious items demand high prices on the market."

Under this system, a Tanist is elected by popular vote of the Dearbhfhine, or the decendants of a previous king up to four generations back, from the available Righdamhna, or kingly material, who are Dearbhfhine of the age of majority and without any physical or mental deformity. Unlike most primogeniture succession laws on the continent, it is common for a brother, uncle, or nephew to be first in line to inheirit, and also unlike most elective monarchy laws on the continent, only the direct descendants of previously ruling kings were eligible.
