 archduchy_government_desc:0 "In 1358, Duke Rudolf IV of Austria issued a document called "Privilegium maius" (Greater privilege). This document, modeled after a previous issue of similar name that elevated the Margravate of Austria to a Duchy, created a further new royal title for Austrian monarchs and elevated the Duke to "Erzherzog", or Archduke.\n\nThe privileges described in the document had great influence on the Austrian political landscape, and created a unique connection between the House of Habsburg and Austria. This title was only officially recognized in 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, when the Habsburgs had solidified their grip on the throne of the de jure elected Holy Roman Emperor, making it de facto hereditary."
