 archduchy_government_desc:0 "In 1358, Duke Rudolf IV of Austria issued a document called "Privilegium maius" (Greater privilege). This document, modeled after a previous issue of similar name that elevated the Margravate of Austria to a Duchy, created a further new royal title for Austrian monarchs and elevated the Duke to "Erzherzog", or Archduke.\n\nThe privileges described in the document had great influence on the Austrian political landscape, and created a unique connection between the House of Habsburg and Austria. This title was only officially recognized in 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, when the Habsburgs had solidified their grip on the throne of the de jure elected Holy Roman Emperor, making it de facto hereditary."

 tuscan_duchy_btc: "Tuscan Grand Duchy"
 tuscan_duchy_btc_desc: "Despite not holding officially any office, Florence had been under informal Medici control since 1434 until the abolition of the Republican constitution. Coming the 15th century they started granting the Ganfoloniere title to members of the family and their allies, which made them the de facto sole rulers of the republic.\n\nBut after a brief revolt and restoration of the older republic without Medici involvement, the republic was sieged and surrendered to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and he decreed only him could determine the government of Florence. It was then when Charles V created the hereditary title of 'Capo' for Medici members, who were further recognized as Dukes by the Pope.\n\nDuring the second half of the 16th century, although not as prestigious as the old republic, the new strengthened Medici government purchased and conquered many territories in Italy, including Siena and Elba, coming to dominate almost the entirety of Tuscany and several cities outside. In August 1569, in the light of Florence's expansion Pope Pius V declared Cosimo de' Medici, a long-term supporter of the Pope, Grand Duke of Tuscany, a title unprecedented in Italy."
