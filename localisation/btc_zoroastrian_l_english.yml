 dg_zoroastrian.026.t:0 "Royal Philanthropy"
 dg_zoroastrian.026.d:1 "Our late ruler has left considerable property to the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] - but with a caveat that it must be spent \"for the soul\".\n\nZoroastrianism emphasised not only charity, but also a responsibility for the souls of the dead.  When a Zoroastrian died, they usually left one part of their property to be inherited normally (\"with right of possession\"), one part in trusteeship, and a third part \"for the preservation of the soul\"."
 dg_zoroastrian.026.d_soul:1 "\nThis last part is the issue at hand: if had been worded \"for religious services for the soul\", it would have been limited to rites and ceremonies only.  Since it is simply worded \"for the soul\", then it can be used any way that is beneficial to the soul - for example, to build temples to Ahura Mazda, give alms to the poor, establish a charitable foundation (\"Ruwanagan\"), or even build roads and bridges for the people - in effect giving the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] considerable leeway on how to spend [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] inheritance."
 dg_zoroastrian.026.d_religious:1 "\nThis last part is the issue at hand: because it is worded \"for religious services for the soul\", it can only be used to pay for rites and ceremonies, whereas if it had been worded simply \"for the soul,\", the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would have had more choice in how to spend the money.  An unscrupulous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] might wish to get out of such a contract, but it would be difficult when the priests were the arbiters."

 dg_zoroastrian.041.t:1 "The Court of Mithra"
 dg_zoroastrian.041.d:1 "One of $MONARCH$'s allies at court has come seeking $RULER_ADJ$ aid.  A religious court (Atash Dadgah) ruled against him in an important case, and now he demands that the $MONARCHTITLE$ repay his loyalty with justice.\n\nOne of the most important roles of Zoroastrian priests was that of Dastur (Judge).  As the holders of the law, they resolved disputes between members of community based on moral judgements.  The aggrieved parties would congregate in a temple before the 'court fire' (Atash Dadgah) which stood in for Asha, the law of God.  There the Dastur would dispense justice in common law cases.  However, this justice was superceded by royal edicts, so petitioners could appeal the ruling at the royal court.  Doing so had the potential to offend, however."

 dg_zoroastrian.042.d:1 "Pious Zoroastrians are flocking to $PROVINCENAME$, having discovered a particularly holy shrine they call 'Pirs-e $PROVINCECAPITAL$'.\n\nPilgrimage is a part of the Zoroastrian faith.  Worshippers travel to old fire temples, ruins and other sites considered to be particularly auspicious - sometimes out of religious discovery, sometimes due to a custom, and sometimes to celebrate a festival.\n\nAlthough there are many such sites in Zoroastrianism, few stand out as unique.  Instead, the ones that prosper due so due to having the infrastructure required to host thousands of pilgrims, and having dedicated funding - often attached lands rented out to tenants - to maintain and repair the site."

 dg_zoroastrian.043.d:1 "A religious controversy is arising in [Root.GetName], as clergy butt heads with laity over the proper way to pray."
 dg_zoroastrian.043.high_priest:1 "\nThe Moaban Mobad has begun a campaign speaking out against the practise of \"Sofre-ye nazri\".  These votive meals are a kind of religious ritual in which men and women gather for a ritual meal, during which they read sacred stories and address Ahura Mazda or his angels with a wish to be fulfilled.  It is a popular practise among the laity, developed over the centuries when priests were scarce, but for many it has replaced the old system of prayers which divided the year into months, each with its own angel and intention for prayers."

 dg_zoroastrian.043.d_men:1 "\nOn the other side is a group of women who claim that the controversy is not in the prayers themselves, but on the fact that they are led exclusively by women - something which seems to disturb the almost exclusively male priesthood."
 dg_zoroastrian.043.d_women:1 "\nOn the other side is a group of mobedyars (female priests) who support the practise and claim that opposition to it is led by sexism, not theology."

 dg_zoroastrian.044.t:1 "Sacrificial Controversy"
 dg_zoroastrian.044.d:1 "A religious controversy is arising in [Root.GetName], as clergy butt heads with laity over the proper way to make sacrifices.\n\nThe Moaban Mobad has begun a campaign speaking out against the practise of animal sacrifice.  The sacrifice of animals to Ahura Mazda was not unheard of, especially a cow or lamb given in thanks for good luck.  There was scriptural support for it in the Avestas and it was part of Persian culture, so ritual sacrifices persisted...and caused controversy.  Many Zoroastrians felt that it belonged more to the pagan heritage of Persia than to the simple, monotheistic faith of individual responsibility that Zoroaster had created - especially when it was combined with the ritualistic drinking of Houma extract.  Was this Daeva-yasna - the worship of false gods that Zoroaster had warned them against?  Or was it Zoroastrian law?  Zoroaster had spoken out against animal sacrifice, but it was the cruelty he was opposed to, not the sacrifice itself.  Whichever side the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] takes will surely affect the acceptance of this practise for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reign."
 dg_zoroastrian.045.t:1 "Crimes against the Divine"
 dg_zoroastrian.045.d:1 "[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is stunned by official charges of infanticide made against one of the highest positions at court!  It appears there is indeed something behind the charges.\n\nThe birth of a child strengthened Ahura Mazda in his war against evil, and hence was one of the greatest things a person could do in their lifetime.  The opposite, then, was to strengthen his opponent and invite evil into the world.  For this reason, infanticide was one of the worst sins in Zoroastrianism - but when a child was not always wanted, it was not unheard of.  In other cases, the charges represented an attack against a pregnant woman who lost the child because of it."
 dg_zoroastrian.045.general:1 "\nIn this case, one of our top generals stands accused.  We could intervene by paying his fine and ordering him to do penance, send a priest to advocate for him, or try to find a legal loophole.  Or we could get rid of the embarrassment lest it contaminate our rule."

 dg_zoroastrian.046.t:1 "The Vices of Priests"
 dg_zoroastrian.046.d:1 "Recently, a Mobed has been demanding extravagant sums in return for forgiveness of sins - a not unheard-of practise, but a venial one.  This particular priest has been particularly transparent about his greed, and those he has coerced into payments include high-ranking officials and their families.\n\nIn Zoroastrianism, the forgiveness of sins was a ritual in which the penitent spent seven to nine days performing a ritual without touching water or fire.  The final step was corporal punishment, but it could be offset by paying a fine commensurate to the sin and to one's station, which meant that a provincial lord was required to pay far more than a sharecropper.  It was not unheard of for a priest to take advantage of this to enrich himself, especially since not all priests had an interest in religion."
 dg_zoroastrian.046.d_no_patriarch:1 "\nUnfortunately, with no high priest to look after the priesthood, this sort of thing is all too common in [Root.GetName]."
 dg_zoroastrian.046.d_patriarch:1 "\nUnfortunately, the Moabadan-moabad is being intransigent on the matter, claiming that we are trying to interfere with a holy duty."

 dg_zoroastrian.047.t:1 "The Priestly Caste"
 dg_zoroastrian.047.d:1 "We are facing a shortage of Mobeds in [Root.GetName].\n\nThis is due primarily to the requirements of Zoroastrian priesthood.  Priesthood was hereditary, passed down from father to son in the Asronih caste, who were barred from marrying outside their caste.  Since only Asronih were allowed to become Mobeds, it meant that the pool of available priests was often smaller than what was needed.  It was possible to increase their numbers by accepting Asronih men who were not devout, but this had its own problems."
 dg_zoroastrian.047.d_1:1 "\nThis is especially pronounced among [Root.GetAdjective] Zoroastrians, who lack a priestly hierarchy which would train and organise priests."
 dg_zoroastrian.047.d_2:1 "\nThis is common among [Root.GetAdjective] Zoroastrians, who still follow a strict caste system."
 dg_zoroastrian.047.d_3:1 "\nAnother option was to allow other castes to take on the role of Herbad - assistant priests who lighten the load on the Mobeds considerably."

 dg_zoroastrian.048.d:1 "A group of worshippers has begun practising Zoroastrianism differently than the official state religion, leading to a heated debate in [Root.GetName] over theology.  On the one hand, this has kindled a religious revival.  On the other hand, it could be seen by some as heresy."
 dg_zoroastrian.048.d_unreformed:1 "\nThis is an unfortunate side effect of having so much of our own faith lost to us.  When we cannot even agree on what constitutes scripture, it should be no wonder that heresy can emerge!"

 dg_zoroastrian.049.t:1 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s Dream"
 dg_zoroastrian.049.d:1 "Last night [Root.Monarch.GetName] had a dream of an Angel that was unusually vivid.  Disturbed, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] sought out a Mobad, since Ahura Mazda has granted them the ability to interpret dreams."
 dg_zoroastrian.049.good_dream:1 "\nThe Mobad listened attentively.  After prayer and meditation, he reports that while the meaning of the dream is still unclear to him, it is clear that Ahura Mazda is sending a message of some kind - almost certainly having chosen the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for greatness in some way!"
 dg_zoroastrian.049.bad_dream:1 "\nAfter meditating on the meaning of the dream, the Mobad reported that it seemed to be a warning of sorts.  He suggested that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] examine [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own conscience and determine if there are any sins [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] needs to confess."
 dg_zoroastrian.049.neutral_dream:1 "\nAfter listening carefully to the dream, the Mobad said that its meaning is unclear - neither a good nor bad omen, but a message that may only become clear after the fact."
 dg_zoroastrian.049.silly_dream:1 "\nHe further suggested that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] be careful not to eat pickled eggplants and drink houma before bed."

 dg_zoroastrian.050.d:1 "A high-ranking Mobad has called upon the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to take part in a ritual cleansing to purify [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sins.\n\nThe Bareshnum was a nine-day-long ritual in which the penitent went through a series of actions designed to bring [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] back to a state of grace with Ahura Mazda.  In return for the ritual, which was complex and involved, the penitent gave the officiants a gift commensurate with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] station.  In return, the ritual cleansed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] of sin - and so was a tacit admission that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had sinned."
