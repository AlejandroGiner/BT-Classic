 estate_btc_mamluks:0 "Mamluks"
 estate_btc_mamluks_desc:0 "This estate represents the Mamluk caste, members of one of the armies of slaves established during the Abbasid era that later won political control of several Muslim states. Typically of foreign extraction in the lands they inhabit, the Mamluks form a distinct part of the army and political classes, and through their military skills and ruthlessness they have been able to become powerful assets as well as wealthy landowners of the countries that house them, even though their reputation for rebelliousness and infighting makes others quite wary of their influence."

 estate_btc_janissaries_desc:0 "This estate represents the Janissary caste, an elite military unit originating in the Ottoman Empire which was instituted through the devsirme system of child slavery, by which young Christian boys were forcibly taken from their families, enslaved and converted to Islam, and incorporated into the Ottoman army.\n\nThey became famed for internal cohesion cemented by strict discipline and order. Unlike typical slaves, they were paid regular salaries. Forbidden to marry before the age of 40 or engage in trade, their complete loyalty to the Sultan was expected.\n\nAs the years went on many of them became powerful governors and landowners, and strongly opposed any attempts at curbing their autonomy and privileges."

 #Qizilbash
 estate_btc_qizilbash:0 "Qizilbash"
 estate_btc_qizilbash_desc:0 "This estate represents the Qizilbash caste, a powerful militant Shi'i organization that flourished in Azerbaijan and Eastern Anatolia from the 15th century, largely made up of members of Turkic tribes that had converted to Shia Islam.\n\nArdent followers of the leaders of the Safavid Order and later Dynasty, the Qizilbash owed implicit obedience to their leader in his capacity as their murshid-e kamil "supreme spiritual director" and, after the establishment of the Empire, as their padishah, changing the purely religious pir – murid relationship into a political one.\n\nApart from being a formidable military force they thus also became important governors and advisors in Persia and beyond, although this rising importance frequently led to clashes with other established political forces in the region as well as infighting."

 #Mamluks Privileges

 estate_btc_mamluks_land_rights_desc:0 "The different Mamluk factions are as greedy as they are scheming. To keep them in line they all need to have their own piece of land to operate in."
 
 estate_btc_mamluks_mamluk_primacy:0 "Primacy of the Mamluks"
 estate_btc_mamluks_mamluk_primacy_desc:0 "Giving the Mamluks free rein over our military would strengthen our capacities considerably, even if it may cost us dearly in compensating their contributions."
 
 estate_btc_mamluks_autonomy:0 "Protect Mamluk Factions"
 estate_btc_mamluks_autonomy_desc:0 "The Mamluks are extremely influential in our realm, and while conflicts between Mamluk groups and with other state actors abound, promising to maintain their historic privileges will go a long way towards making them more cooperative."

 estate_btc_mamluks_promote_leadership:0 "Promote Mamluk Leadership"
 estate_btc_mamluks_promote_leadership_desc:0 "There are many Mamluk factions in our realm, most of them in direct competition with one another. By promoting their most capable leaders to the highest ranks in the military we will increase the efficiency of our armies."

 estate_btc_mamluks_reduce_army_independence:0 "Reduce Mamluk Army Independence"
 estate_btc_mamluks_reduce_army_independence_desc:0 "Given how unruly and ravenous for personal riches the Mamluks in our realm are, an effective measure to curtail their independence would be to attach several non-Mamluks to their own army units. While they would see this as the ultimate affront to their autonomy and military spirit, we would at least be able to benefit from a much stabler military if this were carried out, even if their autonomist tendencies will not be rooted out entirely."

 estate_btc_mamluks_red_sea_trading_posts:0 "Authorize Red Sea Control"
 estate_btc_mamluks_red_sea_trading_posts_desc:0 "Always vying for more influence in the realm, some Mamluk amirs have been eyeing our strongholds overlooking trade in the Red Sea. They claim that they could be able to control the situation better if they were able to run the operation on their own initiative. The merchant guilds will not be happy with this and we are not sure of their competence over trading matters, or the ramifications this decision could have, but maybe allowing them control over our Red Sea coasts will appease them and allow us to make a profit in return."

 estate_btc_mamluks_sudan_somalia_raids_desc:0 "Many among the Mamluk elites are often itching for conflict and raids with which they can increase their prestige as well as their stockpile of gold. Some of them are quite riotous when around the major cities, so it may be prudent to organize some new expeditions further south to keep them busy and away from the capital, and to allow us to obtain more slaves."

 btc_mamluks_somali_raids_tooltip:0 "While this privilege is active, raids to Somalia and South Sudan will take place regularly, bringing §Gmanpower§!, §Gsailors§! and §Gducats§!.\n§RAffected regions will not like this.§!"

 estate_btc_mamluks_rotate_palace_guard:0 "Rotate Palace Guard"
 estate_btc_mamluks_rotate_palace_guard_desc:0 "The Mamluks that are part of the palace guard do an essential job in safeguarding the Sultan, but their loyalty and tendency to look after their own interests has long been worrying for our government. As much as they may see it as an affront, perhaps it's best if we were to rotate the guards so that none of them could get too used to being in the palace as opposed to guarding it..."

 estate_btc_mamluks_enforce_recruitment_levant_desc:0 "As we have successfully curtailed the excesses and disloyalty of many of our Syrian governors, the question remains of what to do with the still restive region. We may be able to convince more people to take on similar positions as before, but this time, under a closer watch from our leadership to ensure they shall comply with our wishes rather than do as they please. In doing so, they may be able to significantly boost our recruitment capabilities in the region. This may upset the locals, but it's not like they ever liked us much in the first place..."

 estate_btc_mamluks_relax_ownership_laws:0 "Relax Ownership Laws"
 estate_btc_mamluks_relax_ownership_laws_desc:0 "An established pattern as of late has been the use of religious institutions as a front by Mamluk landowners in order to increase their possession of agricultural lands. If we were to relax ownership laws, we may be able to rein in these unlawful tendencies, even if the locals would surely be displeased at the increased Mamluk presence in their domains."

 estate_btc_mamluks_entrenched_syrian_governors_desc:0 "Some of the governors of Syria have long maintaned a significant degree of autonomy that has hurt our realm in the long run, what with their blatant corruption coupled with the independentist mindset of many of the inhabitants of the regions. Until we can muster the strength to rein them in, it will remain a thorn in our side."

 estate_btc_janissaries_land_rights:0 "Janissaries Land Rights"
 estate_btc_janissaries_land_rights_desc:0 "Janissaries, despite their ultimate loyalty to the Sultan, face a harsh early life that might give seed to wrong ideas about their status compared to the Ümera. If we allow some of the older units to become landed aristocrats, they will forget future squabbles about their rights."

 estate_btc_janissaries_janissary_primacy:0 "Primacy of the Janissaries"

 estate_btc_janissaries_autonomy_desc:0 "By tradition, the Sultan himself, after authorizing the payments to the Janissaries, visited the barracks dressed as a janissary trooper, and received his pay alongside the other men of the First Division. Securing this tradition for all new Sultans will strengthen the units' relation with the Sultan and make them happier."
 
 #Qizilbash Privileges
 estate_btc_qizilbash_land_rights:0 "Qizilbash Land Rights"
 estate_btc_qizilbash_land_rights_desc:0 "Being tribal units originally, the Qizilbash have direct control over several settlements that used to belong to their forefathers, but conflict between them and other factions of our realm abounds. To solve these conflicts it would be prudent to give them land rights and privileges to institutionalize their claims."
 
 estate_btc_qizilbash_qizilbash_primacy:0 "Primacy of the Qizilbash"
 estate_btc_qizilbash_qizilbash_primacy_desc:0 "Giving the Qizilbash free rein over our military would strengthen our capacities considerably, even if it may cost us dearly in compensating their contributions."
 
 estate_btc_qizilbash_autonomy:0 "Secure Autonomy"
 estate_btc_qizilbash_autonomy_desc:0 "The Qizilbash, devout to our cause as they are, have fiercely resisted attempts at reducing their authority in favor of other factions in the realm, and even though their defiant and unruly character proves concerning for us, guaranteeing autonomy over their internal affairs should hopefully make them less quarrelsome."
