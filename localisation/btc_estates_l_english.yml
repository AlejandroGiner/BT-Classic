 estate_btc_mamluks:0 "Mamluks"
 estate_btc_mamluks_desc:0 "This estate represents the Mamluk caste, members of one of the armies of slaves established during the Abbasid era that later won political control of several Muslim states. Typically of foreign extraction in the lands they inhabit, the Mamluks form a distinct part of the army and political classes, and through their military skills and ruthlessness they have been able to become powerful assets as well as wealthy landowners of the countries that house them, even though their reputation for rebelliousness and infighting makes others quite wary of their influence."

 estate_btc_mamluks_land_rights_desc:0 "The different Mamluk factions are all as greedy as scheming. To keep them happier they all need to have their own piece of ground to operate in."

 estate_btc_mamluks_autonomy_desc:0 "The Mamluks are extremely influential in our realm, and while conflicts between Mamluk groups and with other state actors abound, promising to maintain their historic privileges will go a long way towards making them more cooperative."
 
 estate_btc_mamluks_red_sea_trading_posts:0 "Authorize Red Sea Control"
 estate_btc_mamluks_red_sea_trading_posts_desc:0 "Always vying for more influence in the realm, some Mamluk amirs have been eyeing our strongholds overlooking trade in the Red Sea. They claim that they could be able to control the situation better if they were able to run the operation on their own initiative. The merchant guilds will not be happy with this and we are not sure of their competence over trading matters, or the ramifications this decision could have, but maybe allowing them control over our Red Sea coasts will appease them and allow us to make a profit in return."

 estate_btc_mamluks_sudan_somalia_raids:0 "Authorize Raids to Sudan and Somalia"
 estate_btc_mamluks_sudan_somalia_raids_desc:0 "Many among the Mamluk elites are often itching for conflict and raids with which they can increase their prestige as well as their stockpile of gold. Some of them are quite riotous when around the major cities, so it may be prudent to organize some new expeditions further south to keep them busy and away from the capital, and to allow us to obtain more slaves."
 estate_btc_mamluks_sudan_somalia_raids_effect_tooltip:0 "While this privilege is active, raids to Somalia and South Sudan will take place regularly, bringing manpower £icon_manpower£, sailors £icon_sailors£ and ducats £cash_picture£, as well as lowering opinion of affected nations and adding devastation to affected areas."

 estate_btc_mamluks_rotate_palace_guard:0 "Rotate Palace Guard"
 estate_btc_mamluks_rotate_palace_guard_desc:0 "The Mamluks that are part of the palace guard do an essential job in safeguarding the Sultan, but their loyalty and tendency to look after their own interests has long been worrying for our government. As much as they may see it as an affront, perhaps it's best if we were to rotate the guards so that none of them could get too used to being in the palace as opposed to guarding it..."
 
 estate_btc_mamluks_entrenched_syrian_governors:0 "Entrenched Syrian Governors"
 estate_btc_mamluks_entrenched_syrian_governors_desc:0 "Some of the governors of Syria have long maintaned a significant degree of autonomy that has hurt our realm in the long run, what with their blatant corruption coupled with the independentist mindset of many of the inhabitants of the regions. Until we can muster the strength to rein them in, it will remain a thorn in our side."

 estate_btc_mamluks_enforce_recruitment_levant_desc:0 "As we have successfully curtailed the excesses and disloyalty of many of our Syrian governors, the question remains of what to do with the still restive region. We may be able to convince more people to take on similar positions as before, but this time, under a closer watch from our leadership to ensure they shall comply with our wishes rather than do as they please. In doing so, they may be able to significantly boost our recruitment capabilities in the region. This may upset the locals, but it's not like they ever liked us much in the first place..."
 estate_btc_mamluks_enforce_recruitment_levant_effect_tooltip:0 "Every owned province of §YLevantine§! culture AND §YMuslim§! faith gains '§YForced Recruitment§!, giving the following effects:\nLocal Unrest: §R+5.00§!\nLocal Manpower Modifier: §G+30.0%§!'"
