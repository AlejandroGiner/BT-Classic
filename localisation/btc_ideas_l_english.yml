Many were unsuccessful in claiming the title, but after the Secularization in 1802, Salzburg was able to claim and hold it.\nInterestingly enough, this importance was also reflected in another title: in the Catholic world, there are only two Holy Sees: the Vatican Holy See and the Holy See of Mainz."
 MAI_idea_3:0 "Large Military Household"

It also connected many other cities, like Würzburg to Regensburg."

The town further also lays in a fertiel territory, and there was an extensive agricultural activity meant for export, like fruit, tobacco hemp, millet, but especially grain.\nHowever, Mainz, unlike Frankfurt, was less a commercial center but more a distribution center for goods.\nMainz had the right to oblige that all goods had to be unloaded and offered for sale for at least three days before being retransported. The Bishop secured the fees for them as receipts for the state fund. These were collected in the so-called Brand zu Mainz building."

 MAI_idea_7:0 "Absolute Electors and the Cathedral Chapter"
 MAI_idea_7_desc:0 "The Elector and the cathedral chapter were many times trying to limit each other's power, causing a real dualism. In practice, the Elector had a slight upper hand, as many had to follow him to not lose their position, and thus people tended to obey more to the Elector than to the cathedral chapter.\nOn the other hand, the Elector and the cathedral chapter were mostly of the same social class, and thus of the same interest group. The Electors had an domestic interest in assigning as many relatives as possible in the chapter to stabilize the government, as one of them would have a high chance to becoem the next Elector.\nBut during the age of absolutism, the Electors, especially the enlightened ones, seeked and managed to gain more power."

The Archbishop did all he could; he invited the Jesuits as missionaries, and engaged the help of the emperor.

 AVR_idea2:0 "From Thrones to Khanates"
 AVR_idea2_desc:0 "Our people founded the ancient Christian kingdom of Samir, which ruled Dagestan for generations. Even after being struck down by a Muslim coalition, we merely rose up from the ashes as the Avar Khanate and pushed back the invaders to once again assert our supremacy over the region. No matter how many times they will make us fall over, we will always stand up and fight again in the end."
 AVR_idea3:0 "Auls"
 AVR_idea3_desc:0 "Avar settlements often consist of a single complex building, where the concept of separate ownership, of the integrity and unity of a building is not seen; an entire quarter — perhaps even the whole aul (mountain village) — may consist of a single building, in the sense of an unbroken, continuous structure. Nowhere as in Avaria does the density of houses reach such concentration, where the streets and thoroughfares run like tunnels, sometimes at two levels below the houses, and the densely-packed houses form one great, indivisible amalgamation. The compactness of building was dictated by the necessities of agricultural economy and of defense."
 AVR_idea4:0 "Shield of the Mountains"
 AVR_idea4_desc:0 "In the fourteenth century Tamerlane, "the Conqueror of the Universe," left the mountains, having suffered enormous losses after invading Avaria with a host of 100,000. Let his successors, or any other invader, try again and they shall be met sword in hand!"

Such victories well demonstrate the capabilities of our forces."
 AVR_idea6:0 "Defenders of Dagestan"
 AVR_idea6_desc:0 "Imam Shamil was a powerful Muslim religious leader in the 1st half of the 19th Century, who led the political and military resistance to the Russian conquerors from 1834-1859.

In the second half of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, Avar culture and literature experienced a significant upsurge. Well-known Avar literary figures include the poets Aligaji of Inkho (died 1875) and Chanka (1866-1909), the lyric poet Makhmud (1873-1919), the satirist Tsadasa Gamzat (1877-1951), and the celebrated poet Rasul Gamzatov (born 1923)."

 DRB_idea2:0 "Multicultural City"
 DRB_idea2_desc:0 "Ancient Iranian language elements were absorbed into the everyday speech of the population of Dagestan and Derbent especially during the Sassanian era, and many remain current. A deliberate policy of "Persianizing" Derbent and the eastern Caucasus in general can be traced over many centuries, from Khosrow I to the Safavid shahs Ismail I, and ʿAbbās the Great. According to the account in the later "Darband-nama", after construction of the fortifications Khosrow I "moved much folk here from Persia", relocating about 3,000 families from the interior of Persia in the city of Derbent and neighboring villages."
 DRB_idea3:0 "The Forty Heroes"

When intact, the wall had a height of 9 m (29 ft) and a thickness of about 3 m (10 ft) and, with its iron gates and numerous watch-towers, defended Persia's frontier."

 DRB_idea5:0 "City of Culture"
 DRB_idea5_desc:0 "The Caliph Harun al-Rashid lived in Derbent and brought it into great repute as a seat of the arts and commerce. According to Arab historians, Derbent, with population exceeding 50,000, was the largest city of the 9th century Caucasus. In the 10th century, with the collapse of the Arab Caliphate, Derbent became the capital of an emirate. This emirate often fought losing wars with the neighboring Christian state of Sarir, allowing Sarir to manipulate Derbent's politics on occasion. Despite that, the emirate outlived its rival and continued to flourish at the time of the Mongol invasion in 1239."
 DRB_idea6:0 "Caspian Crossing"
 DRB_idea6_desc:0 "Derbent's location on a narrow, three-kilometer strip of land in the North Caucasus between the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus mountains is strategic in the entire Caucasus region.

The only other practicable crossing of the Caucasus ridge is over the Darial Gorge."

A tukkhum occupied a specific territory, which consisted of the area inhabited by members of the tukkhum, as well as a surrounding area, where the teips, which comprised the tukkhum, engaged in hunting, farming and cattle breeding. Each tukhum spoke their own dialect of the Vainakh language. "
 VAK_idea4:0 "Vainakh Towers"
 VAK_idea4_desc:0 "A characteristic feature of Vainakh architecture in the Middle Ages, rarely seen outside Chechnya and Ingushetia, was the Vainakh tower, a kind of multi-floor structure that was used for dwelling or defense (or both). Military ("combat") towers were 25 meter high or more, with four of five floors and a square base approximately six meters wide. Access to the second floor was through a ladder. The defenders fired at the enemy through loopholes and the top of the tower had mashikul – overhanging small balconies without a floor.
