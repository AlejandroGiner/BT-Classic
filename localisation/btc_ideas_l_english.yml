 FRX_idea_2: "Repel the Saracens"

 FRX_idea_3: "Lessons of Charlemagne"
 FRX_idea_3_desc: "Under Chalemagne, the Frankish Empire found great military sucess on several fronts.

As experts we are often called to decide controversial questions regarding the Magddeburg Rights. These rights contain various trade and merchant rights, marital laws, the abolition of kin liability and the installation of a tribunal."
 MAG_idea_2:0 "Bread House of the Hansa"
 MAG_idea_2_desc:0 "Beginning from the 13th century, Magdeburg was part of the Hansa and a pivotal centre of trade at the Elbe. Also because of the staple right for corn, Magdeburg monopolised the corn trade making it the 'Bread House of the Hansa'."

 MAG_idea_4:0 "Forerunning Primas Germaniae"
 MAG_idea_4_desc:0 "The archbishops of Magdeburg held the title of a Primas Germaniae since a papal bull from 986. Although, there are others holding this title, too, we are the only ones to have adopted the new religious teachings. Therefore, we should use our title to become the forefront of this movement and impose our supremacy!"
 MAG_idea_5:0 "Risen from Ruins"
 MAG_idea_5_desc:0 "Our land and city was completly devastated during the so called Magdeburg Wedding by our intolerant opponents. This coined the phrase Magdeburgisation for such a terror.

 MAG_idea_6:0 "Magdeburg Hemispheres"
 MAG_idea_6_desc:0 "Since we have dissolved Magdeburg's Abbey of St. Augustine and made the latter's library publically accessible for our citizens, the pursuit of knowledge has become a goal of a lot of burghers. One example is Otto von Guericke who made an impressive experiment showing how air pressure works and giving another proof for the existence of vacua. To do so, he connected two airtight half spheres and evacuated the hollow space inbetween with a pump. Thereafter, eight horses on each side weren't able to pull apart the sphere; only after air flowed in again were the horses able to do so."

 MAI_idea_1_desc:0 "The Archbishop-Elector of Mainz was also the Archchansellor of Germany (the others being over Burgundy and Italy), and was as such ranked first among all the ecclesiastical and secular princes of the Empire, and was second only to the Emperor.\nIt served a considerable role as intermediary between the estates of the Empire. It's the Archbishop of Mainz who calls the electors together for an election, who accepts the new Emperor and exercises control over the Reichstag archives. He was formally the most important member of the Reichstag."
 MAI_idea_2:0 "Primas Germaniae"
 MAI_idea_2_desc:0 "The Primas Germaniae was a historical title of honor for the most important Roman Catholic Bishop in the German lands. Many were unsuccessful in claiming the title, but after the Secularization in 1802, Salzburg was able to claim and hold it.\nInterestingly enough, this importance was also reflected in another title: in the Catholic world, there are only two Holy Sees: the Vatican Holy See and the Holy See of Mainz."
 MAI_idea_3:0 "Large Military Household"
 MAI_idea_3_desc:0 "The Archbishop of Mainz maintained one of the largest military households among the ecclesiastical magnates in Medieval Germany. For the Indiculus Loricatorum, a reinforcement consisting of heavy knights requested by Otto II for his campaign in Italy, Mainz gave one of the highest number of cavalrymen, even if they had already sent many. However, the military importance of the Mainzer army had severly declined in modern times."
 MAI_idea_4:0 "Old Roman Road Network"
 MAI_idea_4_desc:0 "Mainz lays at the confluence of the Rhine and the Main Rivers, two major transportation corridors, granting Mainz a position as major river port. Starting from the Roman times, Mainz was an important place regarding connections by road, having branches towards Trier and Metz.\nIn modern times, it held an even more important position, as it also controlled the roads between Madgeburg, Saxony, Hessen and Franconia, and thus secured the route from Pomerania into central Germany. It also connected many other cities, like Würzburg to Regensburg."
 MAI_idea_5:0 "Brand zu Mainz"
 MAI_idea_5_desc:0 "Mainz held an important position in Rheingau region, which is regarded as one of the best vineyard areas of the Empire, and much of this wine passed through Mainz. The town further also lays in a fertiel territory, and there was an extensive agricultural activity meant for export, like fruit, tobacco hemp, millet, but especially grain.\nHowever, Mainz, unlike Frankfurt, was less a commercial center but more a distribution center for goods.\nMainz had the right to oblige that all goods had to be unloaded and offered for sale for at least three days before being retransported. The Bishop secured the fees for them as receipts for the state fund. These were collected in the so-called Brand zu Mainz building."
 MAI_idea_6:0 "Mainz Diocesan Feud"
 MAI_idea_6_desc:0 "After a close election, the Archbishop of Mainz was not recognized by the Pope, who appointed his contender. This eventually became an armed conflict. This war had ravaged the Mainzer lands and caused the end of the existence of the Imperial City of Mainz. The Bishop appointed by the Pope had won the war."
 MAI_idea_7:0 "Absolute Electors and the Cathedral Chapter"
 MAI_idea_7_desc:0 "The Elector and the cathedral chapter were many times trying to limit each other's power, causing a real dualism. In practice, the Elector had a slight upper hand, as many had to follow him to not lose their position, and thus people tended to obey more to the Elector than to the cathedral chapter.\nOn the other hand, the Elector and the cathedral chapter were mostly of the same social class, and thus of the same interest group. The Electors had an domestic interest in assigning as many relatives as possible in the chapter to stabilize the government, as one of them would have a high chance to becoem the next Elector.\nBut during the age of absolutism, the Electors, especially the enlightened ones, seeked and managed to gain more power."

In imitation of the Corpus evangelicorum, the Lutherans of the Salzburg territory formed a league, binding themselves by oath and an outward rite of mutual sprinkling of salt. The Archbishop did all he could; he invited the Jesuits as missionaries, and engaged the help of the emperor. Later he enforced the Decree of the Religious Peace of Augsburg: recantation or emigration. In ten years about 30,000 persons left the territory and settled in East Prussia, or in Würtemberg or Hanoverian territory; a few emigrated to Georgia in North America."

Nowhere as in Avaria does the density of houses reach such concentration, where the streets and thoroughfares run like tunnels, sometimes at two levels below the houses, and the densely-packed houses form one great, indivisible amalgamation.

In the 10th century, with the collapse of the Arab Caliphate, Derbent became the capital of an emirate. This emirate often fought losing wars with the neighboring Christian state of Sarir, allowing Sarir to manipulate Derbent's politics on occasion. Despite that, the emirate outlived its rival and continued to flourish at the time of the Mongol invasion in 1239."

In the second half of the 16th century, numerous books were printed in Slovene, including an integral translation of the Bible by Jurij Dalmatin.

 CUB_idea5_desc:0 "Our nation is vulnerable to enemy landings from all sides, not to mention the continuous pirate activity in the Caribbean. It is important to ensure our fleet is more than ready to take on any adversary. Who knows, perhaps we can also make good money out of this..."
 CUB_idea6:0 "Sugar and Tobacco"
 CUB_idea6_desc:0 "The Tobacco and Sugar plantations in Cuba generated a tremendous amounth of wealth, the latter becoming the most important in the world in the 19th century. Doing so resulted in the development of infrastructure on the island as planters needed safe and efficient ways to transport the sugar from the plantations to the ports, in order to maximize their returns."
 CUB_idea7:0 "A Nation for Everyone"
 CUB_idea7_desc:0 "Even with the history of slavery in Cuba the presence of Africans and Natives in our society is comparatively higher than many of the former Spanish colonies. If we are to mantain stability and economic prosperity it is important to build an inclusive society for all."

 TNV_idea1:0 "City of the Tsars"
 TNV_idea1_desc:0 "Tarnovo served as the capital of the glorious Bulgarian Empire for centuries, and even after foreign subjugation remains dotted with many churches and palaces of the nobility, reminding us of what once was but also of what is important to restore."
 TNV_idea2:0 "The Three Hills"
 TNV_idea2_desc:0 "Tarnovo is situated on three hills, Tsarevets, Trapezitsa, and Sveta Gora, rising amidst the meanders of the Yantra. These hills were the main centers of kings and boyars during the Bulgarian Empire, and Sveta Gora (Holy Mountain) hill remains an important spiritual and literary center. Just as the hill's fortifications have protected us in the past, they shall do so again."
 TNV_idea3:0 "Centers of Learning"
 TNV_idea3_desc:0 "Prior to the Turkish invasions, Tarnovo was among the main European centres of culture and gave its name to the architecture of the Tarnovo Artistic School, painting of the Tarnovo Artistic School, and to literature. It is important to restore these great centers of learning to their former glory if we don't want to be left behind."
 TNV_idea4:0 "Banks of the Yantra"
 TNV_idea4_desc:0 "The catchment area in the Balkan Range is afforested mainly with deciduous forests, and the Yantra catchment area is well wooded and grassed in its pre-mountainous section. Although prone to flooding, the waters of the Yantra provide us with much needed water for drinking and irrigation."
 TNV_idea5:0 "Columns of History"
 TNV_idea5_desc:0 "Some of the Bulgarian Empire's most significant historical records are stored in the Holy Forty Martyrs church in Tarnovo, including Omurtag's Column, Asen's Column and the Border Column from Rodosto from the rule of Khan Krum. These columns were placed in the church by Ivan Asen II as a tribute to his mighty ancestors."
 TNV_idea6:0 "Indomitable Will"
 TNV_idea6_desc:0 "Tarnovo remained the centre of resistance against the Ottoman empire long after the fall of Bulgaria, with several uprisings beginning from the city itself, particularly those of 1598, 1686 and - lastly - 1876. Even as the Ottomans continued to oppress Bulgaria, this only hardened the spirits of the patriots wishing to see the nation reborn anew. We must ensure to never again fall under the control of such tyrants. "
 TNV_idea7:0 "Re-establish the Empire"
 TNV_idea7_desc:0 "As the seat of the Imperial capital it is up to us to take the lead in re-uniting the lands of Bulgaria and forming an Empire that will, once again, give our people the security and prosperity we deserve. No matter who our enemies may be, from the east or west, they will soon tremble before the might of the Bulgarian Empire!"

 BDN_idea1:0 "Shield of Bulgaria"
 BDN_idea1_desc:0 "Ever since the days of the Romans Vidin has been an important stronghold to protect imperial borders, and under the Empire of Bulgaria this was no exception, as the city was a bishop seat and capital of a large province, and its despots were influential figures in the Empire and were on several occasions chosen for Emperors."
 BDN_idea2:0 "Baba Vida"
 BDN_idea2_desc:0 "Vidin's main landmark, the Baba Vida fortress, was built in the period from the 10th to the 14th century, and served as the city's main defensive installation during the course of the Middle Ages and acted as the most important fortress of northwestern Bulgaria."
 BDN_idea3:0 "Defend against Serbia"
 BDN_idea3_desc:0 "Many times throughout history the Serbian kings to the west have desired to add Vidin and the surrounding areas to their possession: even today we can never know when they will strike again. It is important to have a mobile army capable of intercepting them before they lay siege to the city once again."
 BDN_idea4:0 "Echoes of Freedom"
 BDN_idea4_desc:0 "Even after the Ottomans captured Vidin in 1388 and forced the then ruler Sratsimir to become their vassal, the Bulgarians soon rose up in revolt and joined the fight against the Ottomans at the Battle of Nicopolis. Though it ended in disaster, this shows us that in order to win the path towards freedom we need to use subterfuge, and allow us to act against the Turks even if nominally vassals."
 BDN_idea5:0 "Buffer Zone"
 BDN_idea5_desc:0 "Between the 15th and 18th centuries Vidin acted as a buffer zone in the centuries-long wars between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans. Repeated punitive expeditions by the Austrians and brutal crackdowns by the Ottomans depopulated the city at several times, yet, we were always able to rise up again from the ashes. No matter the enemy, we shall never waver in our resolve."
 BDN_idea6:0 "Martyrs on the Altar"
 BDN_idea6_desc:0 "In 1806, during the rule of former Janissary Osman Pazvantoglu, he captured several hundred laymen and priests from Vidin and the surrounding areas, and imprisoned the priests and Bishop Kalinik in the Church of St. Peter, and later slaughtered them before the altar. The martyrdom of the holy men reminds us to never waver in our faith and determination to mantain independence."
 BDN_idea7:0 "The Defense of Vidin"
 BDN_idea7_desc:0 "During the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885, repeated attempts to conquer Vidin by the Kingdom of Serbia failed, and its successful defense of the city, organized by Atanas Uzunov, allowed the Bulgarian army to go on the offensive and win the war decisively in Bulgaria's favor."
