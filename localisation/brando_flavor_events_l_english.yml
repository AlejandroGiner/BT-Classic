 brando_flavor_events.4.t: "The Return of the Salmon"
 brando_flavor_events.4.d: "Our people enjoy an abundance of riches from both land and sea, but the annual return of the salmon is perhaps the most important. As the salmon return to their spawning grounds each year to breed and die, our people are reminded of our connection to the land and sea and the natural cycles we belong too. Every tribe along the Pacific coast knows the salmon is a gift, and we must take special care to honor the sacrifice of the salmon. Celebrating the First Salmon Ceremony brings us closer together as a people and is a sign that the land gives back to those who treat it well. Alternatively, would could use this oppertunity to harvest more than our fair share and prepare a military force to strike at our enemies."
 brando_flavor_events.4.a: "Prepare for the annual First Salmon Ceremony!"
 brando_flavor_events.4.b: "Harvest the bounty of the salmon for our warriors!"
 brando_flavor_events.4.a.tt: "Prepare for the ceremony!"
 brando_flavor_events.5.t: "The First Salmon Ceremony"
 brando_flavor_events.5.d: "We celebrate and honor the salmon with feasts, song, and dance. The first-caught salmon is placed on a bed of ferns and cedar boughs, and after sharing morsels of the cooked fish we return the bones to the water to show the salmon people we have treated their gift with respect."
 brando_flavor_events.5.a: "We honor the gift of the salmon!"
 brando_flavor_events.6.t: "Abundant Acorn Yield"
 brando_flavor_events.6.d: "The tribes of the California region have harvested acorns since time immemorial. We tend the natural groves of oaks that populate our land and are able to harvest hundreds of pounds of acorns from a single tree. The entire village gathers in the fall to process the acorns for storage and to make acorn meal, which can be used to bake bread and cereals. This year, the harvest was particularly plentiful, and we must decide what to do with our surplus."
 brando_flavor_events.6.a: "Let us feed our warriors prepare for battle!"
 brando_flavor_events.6.b: "Let us prepare and store our surplus for harsh times ahead."
 brando_flavor_events.7.t: "The People of the Horse"
 brando_flavor_events.7.d: "No animal has had such a profund impact on our people than the horse. The nations of the Great Plains have embraced the horse as few other cultures could, and our people are no different. They allow us to hunt more, travel farther, and have tipped the balance of power in our favor. Horses are symbols of wealth - they are emblems of tradition, healing, and pride. We have mastered this beast in every conceivable way, and the horse is as much a part of our people as the earth and sky."
 brando_flavor_events.7.a: "Our warriors have adopted the horse and are fearsome to behold!"
 brando_flavor_events.7.b: "Our people use the horse to trade and travel ever greater distances!"
 brando_flavor_events.8.t: "The Islands of the Caribbean"
 brando_flavor_events.8.d: "The islands of the Caribean are stretched out before us. We have many opportunities to explore and expand into new territory, but first we need a way to get there."
 brando_flavor_events.8.a: "Our canoes will take us places!"
 brando_flavor_events.9.t: "The Potlatch"
 brando_flavor_events.9.d: "Among nations of the Pacific Northwest, the potlatch represents an important pillar of community life. A ceremony and feast, the potlatch is meant to redistribute wealth among the tribe, recognize the achievements of and confer status to individuals, kin groups, and clans, and to establish claims to names, powers, and rights to hunting and fishing grounds. Gifts are given, stories are told, and our nation is kept whole. We are presented at this time with the option to hold another potlatch or save our resources for another day."
 brando_flavor_events.9.a: "Hold the potlatch!"
 brando_flavor_events.9.b: "We cannot afford it!"
 brando_flavor_events.10.t: "The European Fur Trade"
 brando_flavor_events.10.d: "Europeans have traded in native furs for decades - even before they made settlements in North America, ships would stop along the coast to trade for furs. Now that the trade has begun in earnest, it has had a profound impact on tribal life. Our people are able to gain access to more advanced tools and weapons, and our trade influence among other tribes is vastly increased. As we compete to supply furs to greedy European markets, let us savor the advancements this trade has brought us!"
 brando_flavor_events.10.a: "We must engage in this lucrative trade!"
 brando_flavor_events.10.a.tt: "The fur trade brings change to our people!"
 brando_flavor_events.11.t: "The Decimation of the Fur Trade"
 brando_flavor_events.11.d: "While the fur trade brought a number of advantages to our people, it has also come with it a terrible price. Where once our economies were based on necesity, now our hunters kill as much as they can. We have decimated our traditional hunting grounds and the populations of beaver, mink, otter, bison, and other animals we hunt for fur are in decline. Competition with neighboring tribes has soured relations, and the cultural impact of European goods and ideas on our people has had inumerable effects outside our control. Bands of our tribe have left to find new hunting grounds, never to return. With our participation in the fur trade, we have invited in new ways of life - ways that have pushed aside the old. We must adapt to this new social landscape if we are to survive as an independent people."
 brando_flavor_events.11.a: "We ignored the balance of life around us - we must live with the consequences."
 brando_flavor_events.12.t: "The Beaver Wars"
 brando_flavor_events.12.d: "Historically, the Beaver Wars were fought between the Iroquois (and their French allies) and multiple tribes throughout the Great Lakes and the Ohio River Valley during the 17th century. This war, or series of wars, of expansion was brought on by the fur trade - as tribes decimated their local fur-producing animal populations, they sought to expand their hunting territory in order to meet European demands for furs. Any tibe large enough to sustain such an expansion, however, could have feasibly done what the Iroquois did - so long as they felt they had the backing to succeed."
 brando_flavor_events.12.a: "With our new allies, we can conquer more territory in our hunt for furs!"
 brando_flavor_events.13.t: "Green Corn Festival"
 brando_flavor_events.13.d:	"Many tribes who practice agriculture have some form of ceremony related to corn - but the Green Corn Festival (or Green Corn Ceremony) is a specific type of religious and social event common among tribes in the Mississippi region and eastern woodlands of North America. The festival takes place over a number of days, and involves the ritual sacrifice of the first fruits of the yearly corn harvest. There is also dancing, feasting, games, and a number of other religious observations specific to the tribes participating. Another common practice during the ceremony is the forgiveness of wrongs - all but the most serious offenses are forgiven during this ceremony. It is traditionally a time of thanksgiving and communal bonding."
 brando_flavor_events.13.a:	"Hold the festival to honor nature's bounty."
 brando_flavor_events.13.b: "Hold the festival and take this oppertunity to encourage our people to better tend the fields."
 brando_flavor_events.14.t: "Expert Canoe Builders"
 brando_flavor_events.14.d: "The tribes of the Pacific Northwest are accomplished sailors in their own right. Using expertly designed canoes, they conduct raids on each other and travel up and down the coast to harvest the bounty of the sea. Let us now rely on our canoes to bring us into a brighter future!"
 brando_flavor_events.14.a: "Our canoes are legendary!"
 brando_flavor_events.15.t: "The Winter Count"
 brando_flavor_events.15.d: "A winter count is a form of calendar and historical record which used pictures to denote significant moments in a particular year. Winter counts were often painted on bison hide and the images themselves were made by a specific memeber of the tribe, the keeper of the count. The keeper would consult with elders to both name the year and create the symbol to use for that year. Images could run in straight lines across the hide, spiral inwards or outwards, or follow specific patterns. The winter counts were used to supliment the oral histories of tribes, providing references to important moments in the collective history of the people. We have an oppertunity to add to our tribe's winter count this year - what shall we choose?"
 brando_flavor_events.15.a: "Add an image representing an achievement of our leader."
 brando_flavor_events.15.b: "Add an image representing a significant event in the lives of our people."
 brando_flavor_events.16.t: "Wampum Exchange"
 brando_flavor_events.16.d: "Wampum - white and purple beads strung together in long belts - is an item that holds a multitude of wealth. It is an expression of worth, both monetary and political, and often serves a spiritual purpose based on the design of the beads themselves. Made from the shells of the whelk and the quahog, wampum was often given or exchanged to mark significant events like births, marriages, the signing of treaties, and occasions for condolence or remembrance. Often mistaken as a form of currency by outsiders, wampum holds more value in its giving and receiving than as a simple commodity. We have an oppertunity to trade wampum with another nation nearby - we can exchange wampum as a symbol of our historical good relations, or we can use this time to manufacture some of our own wampum for our own use."
 brando_flavor_events.16.a: "Send a representative with our request to exchange wampum."
 brando_flavor_events.16.b: "Let us manufacture our own."
 brando_flavor_events.17.t: "Offer to Exchange Wampum"
 brando_flavor_events.17.d: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ has offered to exchange wampum as a sign of our historical relations. Traditionally, we would trade wampum to mark the significance of this event; however, we could also simply exchange wampum among our own leaders, strengthening their social and political positions."
 brando_flavor_events.17.a: "Exchange wampum with our neighbors."
 brando_flavor_events.17.b: "Exchange wampum among our own leaders and elders."
 brando_flavor_events.18.t: "Wampum Exchange Accepted"
 brando_flavor_events.18.d: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to exchange wampum in a ceremony to commemorate the bond between our two peoples. This is a great day for both nations!"
 brando_flavor_events.18.a: "They value our friendship."
 brando_flavor_events.19.t: "Wampum Exchange Rejected"
 brando_flavor_events.19.d: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused our request to exchange wampum. This may lead to a break of our traditionally healthy relations."
 brando_flavor_events.19.a: "They do not value our friendship!"

 decimated_hunting_ground: "Decimated Hunting Grounds"
 desc_decimated_hunting_ground: "The fur trade has all but destroyed local ecosystems here. Trappers cannot find furs worth selling, and the absence of local fauna makes it difficult to sustain large populations through traditional hunting."

 adopt_written_language_title: "Adopt Written Language"
 adopt_written_language_desc: "Our people have long used symbols, pictures, and other forms to represent ideas in the physical world, but our exposure to nations from far beyond the sea has shown us the myriad of benefits that comes from having a standardized written language. Our people deserve to have a history written in their own words - if our ruler is savy enough, they may adopt a written form of our language to be used throughout our nation."
 adopted_written_language: "Standarized Written Language"
 desc_adopted_written_language: "The adoption of a standard written language makes the running of our nation easier and shows the rest of the world we are just as capable of technological and societal advancement."
