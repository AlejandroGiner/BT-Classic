  hellenic_events.103.d: "'The gloomy Hades enriches himself with our sighs and our tears!', yells a priest as a ritual to commemorate the fearsome god Hades begins. A black sheep is sacrificed at the altar, its blood dripping down into a pit or cleft in the ground, as the person who offered the sacrifice averts his face. As silence engulfens the room, the people at the procession bang their hands on the ground to be sure Hades would hear them. 'May his strength and wisdom strengthen us', ends the priest"
  hellenic_events.103.a: "May Hades spare us all!"

  hellenic_events.104.t: "Inspirations of Hades"
  hellenic_events.104.d: "You discussed with scholars and theologians about the great power of Hades, a strict yet not evil God. His great combat abilities, his power over the minerals of the earth and of course as gatekeeper to the underworld, make him a god worthy of absolute respect.

  hellenic_events.109.d: "'All those who make a living trading their wares, offer you incense, and beg you to swell their profits.' thus wrote Ovid. Hermaea, a festival dedicated to Hermes begins. Merchants from all over the city and from near areas have all gathered before the temple of Hermes in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. After offering a sacrifice to the protector of commerce, they draw water from the fountain near the temple and then sprinkle their goods and hair with a laurel bough and pray for good luck."
  hellenic_events.109.a: "A golden key can open any door!"
  hellenic_events.109.b: "Hmm, it is interesting that a god of commerce is also the protector of thieves."
  hellenic_events.110.t: "Inspirations of Hermes"
  hellenic_events.110.d: "You went to a local market recently, a place under protection of Hermes. You found traders trying to cheat their customers. 'Catch the thief!' cried a woman, you squinted in the direction of the voice and saw a boy running with a gold necklace in his hand. 'Smart boy, how could he steal a necklace when its owner is wearing it?' you said to yourself."
  hellenic_events.110.a: "At least trickery can make us rich!"
  hellenic_events.111.t: "Posidea"
  hellenic_events.111.d: "It is Posidea, a festival dedicated to the god of the seas and oceans. Sailors and footsoldiers alike pray to him for a safe voyage and calm waters.

  hellenic_events.111.a: "Poseidon blesses the brave!"
  hellenic_events.111.b: "For the tranquility and stability of the waters is also the stability of the land."
  hellenic_events.112.t: "Inspirations of Poseidon"
  hellenic_events.112.d: "You talked with wise men and read ancient stories, you feel like you have learned much. Alexander the Great paused at the Syrian seashore before the climactic battle of Issus, and resorted to prayers, invoking Poseidon the sea-god, for whom he ordered a four-horse chariot to be cast into the waves."
  hellenic_events.112.a: "A wise ruler would do well to respect such a powerful god."
  hellenic_events.113.t: "Crisis of Faith"
  hellenic_events.113.d: "You acted cynically toward your patron god but didn't get punished, you prayed and received no reply. You feel like you have lost faith in your god while the priests told it is just a crisis of faith that everyone will experience. Maybe I have been praying to the wrong one and it is time to change?"
  hellenic_events.113.a: "It is a test of gods which I shall pass."
  hellenic_events.113.b: "Zeus is the supreme god."

  #Waldensian
  waldensian: "Waldensian"
  waldensian_religion_desc: "Originally a reform movement within the Catholic church, the Waldensians were forced to turn anti-clerical following their excommunication and advocated for a return to vows of poverty and earlier forms of Christianity. The religion takes its name from its founder Peter Waldo, who began preaching in Lyon and surrounding areas in the 12th century. Waldensians are opposed to capital punishment and believe that laymen can also administer the sacraments. The Protestants eventually considered Waldensians as precursors to the Reformation.\n\nIn the game the Waldensian faith has been significantly cut down by repression and mostly survives in the remote mountainous regions of Piedmont and Arpitania."

  waldensian_events.1.t: "Hypocritical Priest"
  waldensian_events.1.d: "Our religion teaches the value of austerity, and displays of great wealth undoubtedly go against not only the teachings of our founder Peter Waldo, but those of Jesus Christ himself. It has not been easy to convince the clergy and nobility of our nation to abandon such pathetic attachment to wordly riches, but in this case, something even worse has happened.\n\nOne of our most well known preachers in [event_target:waldensian_province.GetAreaName] has done a great job convincing the locals of the need of simplicity and humbleness, but we have found that in his private life, he definitely does not practice what he preaches. He often entertains foreign merchants and emissaries by displaying his vast collection of antiques, organizing sophisticated banquets and boasting about the political power he enjoys in our nation.\n\nWhile his duties as a man of God have been much appreciated, it is now clear that he has overstepped his authority and become one of those people he criticizes in his sermons. Should we replace him, it would greatly anger his supporters in the province, but if we keep men like him around, our nation eventually would be known only as a hive of scum and villainy."

  waldensian_events.2.t: "A Sense of Security"
  waldensian_events.2.d: "Many of the historical Waldensian communities lived on mountain plateaus, particularly in Piedmont. This made them more isolated from the rest of the Catholic community, but also made their towns and villages much more easily defensible even from overwhelming enemy forces. The good men of [event_target:waldensian_province.GetName], having treasured their newfound peace and prosperity, have set out to mantain it and have come to us with an interesting proposal: using honed tactics their ancestors passed on when it comes to defending the plateau, they claim they can greatly strengthen the defenses over the entire area, possibly even including provinces that are not mountainous. Doing so, they say, will deter any future aggression and ensure these peaceful communities continue to enjoy prosperity for years to come."

  waldensian_events.3.t: "An Unsafe Pilgrimage"
  waldensian_events.3.d: "As we all know and despite the lies of the papacy and others, pilgrimage serves only to spend one's money and is not a pious act at all, unlike helping those in need. Despite this, pilgrimages remain popular in all Christian nations including our own, and the province of [event_target:waldensian_province.GetName] has recently become a popular site for pilgrims as it was the site where a popular monk was martyred many years ago. So far we have turned a blind eye to this, but we are increasingly receiving reports that people have been disappearing in the area, apparently taken by highwaymen or even wild beasts. With the pilgrimage already being barely tolerated, we now have an excuse to finally curtail these activities, even if it may anger the pilgrims."

  waldensian_events.4.d: "The rich aristocracy has always resented the policies of austerity we have been implementing, seeing them as an insult to their status and heritage. While we are generally able to find a compromise with the landowners, recently the nobles have been particularly upset, and a recent incident has caused tensions to flare up between the nobility and the religious establishment to a dangerous degree. Yesterday the son of an important noble was publicly criticized by a priest for his extravagantly expensive clothing, and his father did not take it well: he has requested a meeting with you in order to convince you to punish the clergy responsible for the insult while voicing the nobility's desire for their status to be respected and not loathed. It is true that, as the noble says, we are all sons of God, but the clergy has pointed out that if we do not enforce what we preach, how are we any different from the Antichrist in Rome?"
  waldensian_events.4.a: "We may all be sons of God, but it is clear only some of us are interested in defending His name."
  waldensian_events.4.b: "We are all sons of God, and we all deserve to live in peace without being criticized by hypocritical priests."

  waldensian_events.5.d: "The desire for stability is strong, but sometimes it is not even military confrontations that threaten peace. Recently one of our neighboring nations has gone out of its way to point out the alleged 'weakness of spirit' and 'pathetic state of our army' right in front of our officers and diplomats. They claim that our religious and political doctrines promote the weak and feeble, and our shunning of great wealth simply showcases our barbaric and uncultured nature. Normally we would ignore these vile remarks and expel the diplomats of these scoundrels, but it seems they have taken it a step further and have begun spreading such rumors to other nations, fearless of the possible consequences. Surely we cannot allow this to continue?"
  waldensian_events.5.a: "Well if it's a show of force they want, they'll get one!"

  waldensian_events.6.d: "Our nation is home to many merchants and artisans, native and foreign, eager to exploit trade for their own selfish benefit. Yet these men are still important to our nation, and a sentiment of mutual understanding was reached long ago. Nonetheless, many merchants do not like how some goods appear to be out of the scope of our market due to our shunning of opulence. Recently a delegation of merchants has come to us and politely asked for less scrutiny when it came to trade, claiming that if they were able to get better and more expensive goods into the country it would be for the benefit of everyone. Even disregarding the clergy's predictable advice, still others in the court claim that this is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt on the merchants' part to start a smuggling operation."
  waldensian_events.6.a: "We'll just have to see what happens."

  waldensian_events.7.d: "La Nobla Leyczon, 'The Noble Lesson', is the founding document of the Waldensian creed. Anonymously written centuries ago near Lyon, for many generations it only survived as a smuggled document to prevent it from being confiscated and burned by Papist authorities. Now that we have finally established firm Waldensian authority in [Root.GetName], it has become a tradition to periodically read passages from La Nobla Leyczon in huge gatherings. Such events are often attended by foreign dignitaries, but have been known to cause significant animosity among Papist nations, and of course in the Papacy itself. We will not let their anger dictate our beliefs, but perhaps we may want to be a bit more cautious about it this time?"
  waldensian_events.7.a: "We will read it! And they'll hear it loud and clear!"
  waldensian_events.7.b: "No point in making an incident out of this..."
  
  waldensian_events.8.t: "Traveling Preachers"
  waldensian_events.8.d: "Peter Waldo and his followers developed a system whereby they would go from town to town and meet secretly with small groups of Waldensians. There they would confess sins and hold service. A traveling Waldensian preacher was known as a 'barba'. The group would shelter the barba and help make arrangements to move on to the next town in secret. Even as our faith has been institutionalized, we have not abandoned this practice and the barbas continue to provide us with new converts and resources."
  waldensian_events.8.a: "Wonderful."
  
  waldensian_events.9.t: "Foreign Merchants are Thankful"
  waldensian_events.9.d: "Merchants are often considered to be selfish, wicked individuals interested only in their personal wealth at the expense of everyone else. Nonetheless, recently, a surprising turn of events has occurred. A delegation of foreign merchants has arrived at the court, and seeking an audience with [Root.Monarch.GetName], they praised the peace and stability of our realm, claiming that our officials are particularly honest in their dealings and that it has been a pleasure for them to work with us. Some of them have even considered becoming Waldensians and relocating their operations in our nation permanently, bringing their knowledge with them."
  waldensian_events.9.a: "We are delighted."
  
  waldensian_events.10.t: "Provincial Crisis"
  waldensian_events.10.d: "It appears that one of our provinces has recently been hit by a series of landslides. This would not normally be a significant problem, but it appears that local officials have taken the principle of austerity a little too literally, and have essentially denied the local population even the most basic needs in terms of efficient infrastructure. We have since replaced these officials but the area is now in a significantly bad shape, so something has to be done in order to allow the people of [event_target:waldensian_province.GetName] to live and work normally again."
  waldensian_events.10.a: "We will do what we can to help them."
  waldensian_events.10.b: "Neighboring provinces must show solidarity and help them rebuild."
  waldensian_events.10.c: "It was God's will."
  
  waldensian_events.11.t: "Preachers Imprisoned"
  waldensian_events.11.d: "Horrifying news! A sizeable group of barbas operating in a foreign nation have been betrayed by the very person who was supposed to give them shelter and imprisoned by the authorities. This is not only a significant loss of valuable preachers for our cause, but also a blow to the prestige of our organization since a traitor was able to infiltrate our preacher group this easily. Either way, our missionary activities will be less effective for years to come."

  waldensian_events.20.d: "The rulers of [Root.Getname] have been welcomed by the people following their conversion to the Waldensian faith and have been considered important political actors in the reformation. Nonetheless, many people have not forgotten how the older, Papist Savoys used to persecute the innocent people of Piedmont with vile massacres and unjust exiles. As a result many have increasingly complained about the reverence the ruling family still shows towards their ancestors, with statues and naming conventions to honor the past oppressors. We have so far claimed that it is up to God to forgive them for the persecution, but popular sentiment has increasingly turned against what they claim is reverence towards followers of the Antichrist in Rome, and we must at last decide what to do."

  waldensian_events.21.t: "Lyon is Ours!"
  waldensian_events.21.d: "The beautiful city of Lyon is finally in Waldensian hands! This is the city where our founder Peter Waldo first began preaching and denouncing the sins of the Papist establishment. He was inspired by a series of events, firstly, after hearing a sermon on the life of St. Alexius, secondly, rejection of transubstantiation when it was considered a capital crime to do it, thirdly, the sudden and unexpected death of a friend during an evening meal. From this point onward he began living a true Christian life, giving his property over to his wife, while the remainder of his belongings he distributed as alms to the poor. At about this time, Waldo began to preach and teach publicly, based on his ideas of simplicity and poverty, notably that 'No man can serve two masters, God and Mammon.' Waldo condemned what he considered as papal excesses and Catholic dogmas, including purgatory and transubstantiation. He said that these dogmas were 'the harlot' from the book of Revelation.\nAs a result, the city of Lyon holds great value for our faithful, and many are demanding that we hold a celebration for such a historical moment. Others however claim such worldy undertakings would only result in us distancing ourselves further from Waldo's own teachings. What shall we do?"
  waldensian_events.21.a: "We will make sure to evangelize his teachings to the world!"

Waldo was excommunicated by Pope Lucius III during the synod held at Verona in 1184, and after that, he and some of his devout followers escaped Arpitania, headed to other places in Europe in search of safety. Some say he escaped to Germany, others say to Italy, but while we know he was never captured, his ultimate destination remained a mystery.\nUntil now.\nA group of men has recently come forward claiming to have known where Waldo's ultimate burial place was. This has piqued great interest among our faithful, claiming that he should be given a proper burial in a church in Lyon, instead of staying in the ditch his remains were found in. Many however remain skeptical regarding the true nature of these remains, claiming there is no evidence to back up the men's claim."
  waldensian_events.22.a: "We shall consecrate a new Cathedral and bury him there!"
  waldensian_events.22.b: "Uh, I'm pretty sure this is not him."

  waldensian_events.23.t: "A Most Unwise Decision"
  waldensian_events.23.d: "What many have feared over the past months has finally revealed itself to be true! The remains we buried in the Lyon cathedral are, in fact, not those of our founder Peter Waldo! Officials who went to the site of the burial, by analyzing the population census and talking to the locals, confirmed that the remains are those of a former Papist soldier, who was even guilty of persecution against our people! This is a humiliating blow against our leadership, as despite our best efforts to keep this silent the word has already spread that we have buried a Papist murderer in our most sacred cathedral."

  vow_of_poverty_title: "Vow of Poverty"
  vow_of_poverty_desc: "Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, lived in simplicity together with his followers and taught them the true meaning of life on this planet, to prepare us for the life that comes after it. He was vehemently against all signs of opulence but this is something that has sadly been forgotten by many of our fellow Christians. But not us. We must make a vow of poverty, for even as a ruling class we must not revel in arrogance and false securities, lest we forget that we are all children of God and worthy in His eyes through our actions, not through our possessions."
  vow_of_fidelity_title: "Vow of Fidelity"
  vow_of_fidelity_desc: "The virtue of fidelity is one that is often lost on modern rulers. So many so-called Christians claim they can take a spouse, only to divorce her the next day. With rulers like these, it is no wonder that the nations they rule are so prone to rebellion. We must make a vow of fidelity, for fidelity is just another form of devotion, it is the state of being full of faith in the sense of steady devotion to someone. It means keeping one's promises no matter the prevailing circumstances, just as God's covenant to love his people. "
  vow_of_peace_title: "Vow of Peace"
  vow_of_peace_desc: "'Thou shall not kill'. This was a fundamental teaching of early Christianity, but to illustrate how shamefully it has been corrupted, some Popes have personally taken up arms and joined soldiers in pointless wars that only served to further the suffering of mankind on this planet. We must make a vow of peace, so that we can let it be known among our people as well as those of other nations that we do not intend to cause any harm to mankind, but we only want to live decently and prepare ourselves for what comes after."
  vow_of_abstinence_title: "Vow of Abstinence"
  vow_of_abstinence_desc: "There are many evils in this world that distract us from being able to lead a peaceful existence. Besides war and suffering, many are things that cause otherwise decent men to fall into despair. Wine is sacred to us, but substances like wine can often end up being used in a way that destroys the people's souls. We must make a vow of abstinence, declaring that we will not waste time with wordly pleasures and restricting the use of alcohol and other such substances to religious ceremonies."
  vow_of_charity_title: "Vow of Charity"
  vow_of_charity_desc: "A core tenet of being a good Christian is being kind to those less fortunate than us. Many people do not have food or clothing and this cannot be considered to be acceptable. We must make a vow of charity, for the resources of the nation we have built should finally be placed to the benefit of everyone involved, not just a select few. It is through helping others that we can obtain self-fullfilment and a way to a better place once we are done with our mortal lives."

  #Nestorian
  nestorian: "Nestorian"
  nestorian_religion_desc: "Nestorianism is an ancient Christian branch which states that Christ has two separate natures - one divine and one human. This is the opposite of the Monophysite position where Christ has but a single nature. The nominal head of the Nestorian Church is the Patriarch of the East. Spread by the Apostles who went east into Persia, the Church of the East spread through the Middle East and into Asia. Despite the name, Nestorianism indicates mostly adherence to the Church of the East rather than strict belief in Nestorius' own teachings. Without state support the Church gradually died out in many places, leaving behind beautiful churches and haunting graveyards.\n\nIn game Nestorians have largely been supplanted following the Islamic and Mongol invasions, with isolated pockets remaining in a few places in Asia."

  nestorian_events.1.t: "Church Renovations"
  nestorian_events.1.d: "Many of our churches are of very ancient construction, some made by enlarging a natural cave by means of heavy stone walls in front of the precipitous mountain rock. Many of the towns and accompanying churches thus are in urgent need of repairs and renovations, and many priests are complaining that they are quite dependant on their own exertions for subsistence. The people of [nestorian_province.GetAreaName] have thus appealed to us for help, claiming that all their requests fell on deaf ears while they were ruled by past infidels, and now look up to us as a government able to restore their homeland to its former glory. It is up to us to choose what action to take."

  nestorian_events.2.d: "Recently it has come to our attention that an intelligent young man from [mountain_province.GetName] has made name for himself as a guide and escort to priests, diplomats and merchants alike. Directing convoys through storms and snowstorms, protecting them from marauders in dangerous mountain passes and managing to find the right path to take when all hope seemed lost are but a few of the incredible stories we have heard about him. As a result, because of the treacherous and spread out nature of the lands we administer, many have said that it would be wise to approach him and convince him to serve us in a military role."

  nestorian_events.3.t: "Approaches to Liturgy"
  nestorian_events.3.d: "The magnificent Nestorian churches, mostly built in the mountains, are very solid stone edifices, with arched roofs. Some of them have stood for more than fourteen centuries. For the narrow door, which would not admit a man without much stooping, the usual explanation is given, 'Strait is the gate', a truth of which the Nestorians wish to be reminded when entering the sanctuary. The prayers and the singing or chanting of the psalms are all in the ancient Syriac language, and quite unintelligible to the common people. But one of the priests has begun reading a portion of the Gospels, and giving the translation into the vulgar language spoken by the local Nestorians, and this constitutes the preaching. Some among the clergy and the locals are claiming that more of the service should be held in the local vernacular, but the highest ecclesiastical authorities claim that doing so would merely ruin the quality of our processions and expose our services to foreign interference. How should we handle it?"
  nestorian_events.3.a: "We should bring the ceremony closer to the people."
  nestorian_events.3.b: "We have nothing to change in these ancient traditions."

  nestorian_events.4.t: "Sabbath"
  nestorian_events.4.d: "It is a sacramental occasion: the Sabbath. Nestorians pride themselves in having mantained traditions closely related to the ones of the first Christians. The bread and wine are consecrated in the sanctuary of the church, and then brought out by a priest and a deacon, while each member of the church goes forward in rotation, and partake of a small piece of the bread from the hand of the priest, who holds a napkin to prevent any particles from falling, as he puts the morsel into the mouth of the communicant; and then he drinks off the wine, which was held with great care by the deacon, so that not a drop should be spilled. In these rituals there is nothing of that idolatrous adoration of the host, so characteristic of the mass of the Romanists and the other Oriental churches that turned their backs at us so long ago. On the contrary, there is almost a scriptural simplicty in the observance of this solemn ordinance."

  nestorian_events.5.t: "Hard Times"
  nestorian_events.5.d: "This winter has been especially hard for the people of [nestorian_province.GetName], with storms and landslides dealing great damage to their settlements. The ill-fated inhabitants had to take refuge in nearby highlands, only for them to be attacked by marauders as they were attempting to return to what remains of their town. Our officials have encountered a miserable remnant of them trying to repair their dilapidated dwellings, and prepare for the next winter. In answer to our inquiries, some of them said they had not bread to eat, and begged us to supply their necessities. It is obvious that their buildings need to be repaired and the marauders lurking in the nearby highlands must be hunted down: the question is, do we have the time and resources to devote to these people?"

Such restrictions are completely unacceptable and would seriously harm our influence on the trade routes, but we may not necessarily have the time or resources to be able to counteract this issue currently, as refusing to abide by these new terms would seriously harm our relations with [trade_neighbor.GetName]."
