 resurgent_BYZ.2.d:0 "The Black Sea trade has historically been a great source of income for the Empire. However, as the Empire's influence and power waned after the battle of Mantzikert when the Seljuks settled in Anatolia, the area saw the arrival of Latin merchants in the Black Sea, which was expanded greatly after the events of the 4th Crusade. In return for the Genoese helping in recovering Constantinople, the then Emperor of Nicaea Michael VIII Palaiologos would expel the Venetians from the Black Sea in favor of the Genoese. While Michael did indeed expel the Venetians from the Black Sea strait, the Empire would never recover and its power would keep waning as the encroaching turks conquered more and more of the Empire. \n\nConsidering that the Empire has now risen from the ashes, we have reason to offer a treaty to the Genoese merchants that greatly increases their trade potential, in exchange for placing their Black Sea trading posts directly under our rule."

With both horse and horseman being fully clad in armour, armed with either a lance and small shield or a bow, when the unit would charge in line formation against the enemy there were few that would dare to even face them. Some historians revere them as the counterpart of the Legionnaires of Rome as a symbol of their military might.

Once the city fell to the Roman Empire after a disastrous siege, however, the city was left in such a poor state that it was considered uninhabitable. Emperor Hadrian in year 130 vowed to rebuild the city of Jerusalem as a gift to the Jewish people and restore the Second Temple that had been so thoroughly destroyed. When visiting the ruins, however, he was advised that rebuilding it would cause the Jews to rebel against the Empire. As such, Jerusalem instead was rebuilt into a Roman colony, including temples for Roman paganism. Perhaps ironically, this sparked an event known as the Bar Kokhba revolt, one of three conflicts conducted between the Roman Emperors and the Jews. This uprising enraged Hadrian, who put down the revolt and placed a ban on the Jewish people, prohibiting them from ever setting foot in the city except on the day of Tisha B'Av. Entering the city on any other day as a Jew was punishable by death. The city was renamed Aelia Capitolina and the roman province changed from Judea to Syria Palestina. As such, the city was transformed into a soldier camp up until Emperor Constantine I, when the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built and the city's See was granted special honour, to later on become the seat of a Patriarch. These events resulted in the city becoming completely depopulated of Jews, which remained the case for the remainder of Roman rule. The Arabs later conquered the city, but the Jewish people would not return to their city until much later (Aside from a brief period under Saladin and the Ottomans). \n\nAs the city once more is in Roman hands, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will get to decide its future."

 resurgent_BYZ.37.d:0 "Greek Fire was the name given to the substance deployed by the Greeks, both on water with their Dromons and later on land with catapults. The more famous ship variant was deployed by method of a \"siphon\", a tube-shaped projector, whereas the land version on catapults was deployed through soaking cloth-clad caltrops in the substance. Said to be invented by Kallinikos from Heliopolis in Phoenice when he arrived to Constantinople in 672, it was used with great success in combating the Arabs, supposedly playing an integral part in repelling them from the 1st (674-678) and 2nd (717-718) siege of Constantinople. It later on also played a part in some decisive victories against the Saracens under the resurgence of the Macedonian dynasty, civil wars as well as during wars against the Bulgars and the Rus'. Said to not be extinguished by water, it was revered highly among the Byzantines. In the famous book called De Administrando Imperio, it was described as a gift from the heavens, a divine intervention, claimed to have been \"shown and revealed by an angel to the great and holy first Christian emperor Constantine\". The recipe was guarded heavily in an attempt to make sure it never fell into enemy hands. Despite this, the substance itself was successfully acquired by the Empire's enemies, such as the Bulgars and the Arabs, however they never replicated the method of deployment used by the Byzantines. Instead, in the case of the Arabs, similar incendiary substances were deployed with catapults and grenades instead of \"by siphon\". There is however one account where the Crusaders claim to have seen the Saracens use \"Greek Fire\" in the 13th century. What the substance itself consisted of was never known; some early accounts claim it to be based on niter or phosphide, however most scholars today claim it to be based on naphta, crude oil, perhaps gathered from the wells in the Black Sea around Tamatarcha (Today called Taman) or the Middle East.

Before you seat yourself in the Imperial Throne, crowning yourself the new Basileus/Basilissa of the remnants of the Roman Empire and attempting its restoration, I'd like to thank you for using this mod! Herein lies many features that are intent on enhancing your gameplay experience as Byzantium, to update the Purple Phoenix DLC to current vanilla standards and attempt to explore what could have been, had Byzantium survived the Ottoman onslaught. \n\nNow, the only reason why this event shows up is because, due to popular (or unpopular but vocal) opinion, the events in the mod "Byzantium Events" that have previously been integrated into this mod have been asked to be provided as is, without my modifications. Reasons why ranges from not liking my particular content to preferring how much easier the earlygame gets with the unmodified events. As such, I have opted to include these events for you to decide whether you want the modified (Recommended) versions, or if you want the events as they are. \n\nTo give an explanation what this means, essentially if you pick my modified version, you'll get a fully compatible set of events that enhances the game for Byzantium while attempting not to stray far away from what you could expect to see in vanilla, had Paradox decided to like Byzantium just a little bit more. If you instead pick the unmodified version, be prepared that things will be considerably easier to the point of literally guaranteeing you will obliterate the Ottomans if you at least know how to play the game decently, as well as there being particular incompatibilities that may or may not hamper gameplay. Any bug or balance reports based on this version will not be taken into consideration. \n\nNow that you have been informed, your first decision as the new Basileus/Basilissa of the Roman Empire is to decide whether you want my take on how Byzantium should play, or whether you want the original mod's events."

 integrated_byz_events.10.d: "Giovanni Giustiniani Longo was a young Genoese captain, a member of one of the greatest families of the Republic, a kinsman to the powerful house of Doria in Genoa, and protostrator of the Eastern Roman Empire. He led 700 professional soldiers, both Genovese and Greeks from the island of Chios, which at the time was part of the Republic of Genoa, to the defense of Constantinople against the Ottoman army of Sultan Mehmed II in 1453. He personally financed, organized and led this expedition on his own initiative, and upon arriving was placed in command of the land defenses by Emperor Konstantinos XI Palaiologos of the Byzantine Empire. Giustiniani was key in controlling the land forces and keeping the Greeks, Genoese and Venetians from arguing with each other, and instead kept focused on repairing the land walls after the Ottoman cannon had shot holes in them. It was at least partly because of Giustiniani's charisma that the Byzantine forces were able to hold out so long against overwhelming odds. On May 29, 1453, during the final attack by Mehmet II, Giustiniani was wounded by an Ottoman cannon while defending the walls of Constantinople. Some sources say the wound was caused by a crossbow bolt. Sources disagree about whether the wound was to his arm, leg, or chest, but it forced him to withdraw from his station at the land wall. He exited through the locked gate into the city, which opened up the opportunity for the fearful to flee, and panic spread throughout the lines. Seeing the demoralization caused among the defenders by Giustiniani's retreat, Sultan Mehmed II ordered a renewed assault that eventually defeated the Byzantines and Constantinople was taken by the Turks. Although Giustiniani's men managed to escape with their general after its fall, Giustiniani died from his wounds in the 1st of June 1453."

 integrated_byz_events.11.d: "The Theodosian Walls were without a doubt among the most important defensive systems of Late Antiquity. For a thousand years they have held off invaders threatening the Roman Empire. Indeed, they were perhaps the most successful and influential city walls ever built – they allowed the city and its emperors to survive and thrive for more than a millennium, against all strategic logic, on the edge of an extremely unstable and dangerous world... With the advent of siege cannons, however, the fortifications became obsolete, but their massive size still provided effective defence, as demonstrated during the Second Ottoman Siege in 1422. In the final siege, which led to the fall of the city to the Ottomans in 1453, the defenders, severely outnumbered, still managed to repeatedly counter Turkish attempts at undermining the walls, repulse several frontal attacks, and restore the damage from the siege cannons for almost two months. Finally, on 29 May, the decisive attack was launched, and when the Genoese general Giovanni Giustiniani was wounded and withdrew, causing a panic among the defenders, the walls were taken. After the capture of the city, Mehmed had the walls repaired in short order among other massive public works projects, and they were kept in repair during the first centuries of Ottoman rule. \n As cannons are becoming ever so common, the walls at this point are no longer practical and remain only for ceremonial purposes."

 integrated_byz_events.16.d: "Demetrios Palaiologos was born in around 1407 as the fifth son of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, younger brother to John VIII and Constantine XI. He had very high ambitions within the Empire despite being fifth son, which lead to great conflict in the imperial family. He was granted the court title of despot in accordance with standard practice. Despite then receiving possession of the island of Lemnos from his father in 1422, he refused to live there and fled to the court of King Sigismund of Hungary. He however returned to Constantinople some years later. Demetrios lost his possession of Lemnos in 1440 as he prematurely left from the Council of Florence to Constantinople due to being declared an enemy of the Union. Instead, he was granted appanage of more distant Mesembria, from which he staged a coup and sieged Constantinople with support from the Ottomans. He was then imprisoned in Selymbria for a brief period of time. As Emperor John VIII died, he exploited his proximity to Constantinople by attempting to seize the throne from Constantine, then ruling in distant Morea. Unlike his brothers, Demetrios was an anti-unionist, which helped him secure some popularity, however thanks to Manuel's wife and the brothers' mother Helena Dragaš, Constantine's ascendance to the throne was secured. He finally ended up as governor of Morea together with the final brother Thomas, which he ruled until its conquest."

 integrated_byz_events.27.d: "Loukas Notaras (5 April 1402 - 3 June 1453) was the last Megas Doux of the Byzantine Empire. This position (literally Grand Duke, but more appropriately Lord High Admiral) had been expanded under the late Palaiologid emperors and functioned as an unofficial Prime Minister, overseeing the Imperial Bureaucracy in place of the Megas Logothetes who had previously exercised this function. In 1424, Notaras was one of three emissaries—along with Manuel Melachrenos and George Sphrantzes—who negotiated a treaty of friendship between Emperor John VII Palaiologos and Sultan Murad II of the Ottoman Turks at the end of the Ottoman Interregnum. His continued importance as an imperial official is attested by his presence at the marriage of the future Emperor Constantine Palaiologos to Caterina Gattilusio 27 July 1441. During the siege of Constantinople, Notaras led the troops along the north-western Sea Wall. Some accounts of the siege have him deserting his post after the Ottoman banner was raised on the tower above the Kerkoporta; again, however, this may have been politically motivated slander. In any case, he was able to hold the Sea Wall—which had been the point of entry of all earlier successful attacks on the city—against the Turkish fleet until the breach along the Mesotechion rendered his efforts moot. Notaras, his Palaiologina wife and his son were all captured by the Turks and originally granted clemency in the name of reestablishing order and in exchange for much of Notaras's fortune, which he had had the sense to invest abroad in Venice in the form of dowries for his children. Nonetheless, he was executed shortly after along with his son and son-in-law."

He was one of the chief pioneers of the revival of Greek learning in Western Europe. In Mistra he taught and wrote philosophy, astronomy, history and geography, and compiled digests of many classical writers. His pupils included Basilios Bessarion and George Scholarius (later to become Patriarch of Constantinople and Plethon's enemy). He was made chief magistrate by Theodore II. In 1415 and 1418 he wrote pamphlets to Theodore and Manuel describing how the Empire could be reorganized according to Plato's Republic, with political, legal and economic reforms, and gained even greater reputation as a legal thinker, with rumours that he carried entire legal codes in his memory. In 1428 Gemistos was consulted by Emperor Ioannes VIII on the issue of unifying the Greek and Latin churches, and advised that both delegations should have equal voting power. He re-introduced Plato's thoughts to Western Europe during the 1438–1439 Council of Florence, a failed attempt to reconcile the East-West schism. Here Pletho met and influenced Cosimo de' Medici to found a new Platonic Academy, which, under Marsilio Ficino, would proceed to translate into Latin all Plato's works, the Enneads of Plotinus, and various other Neoplatonist works. After his return to the Peloponnese, Gemistos founded a school. He taught polytheism as opposed to monotheism, and some of his students prayed to statues of the pagan deities. He died in 1454."

 integrated_byz_events.46.d: "The Hexamilion wall is a defensive wall constructed across the Isthmus of Corinth guarding the only land route into the Peloponnese peninsula from mainland Greece. The wall was constructed in the period between 408 AD and 450 AD, in the reign of Theodosius II during the time of the great Barbarian invasions into the Roman Empire. The attack of Alaric on Greece in 396 AD or the sack of Rome in 410 AD by the Visigoths may have motivated the construction, which included towers, sea bastions, and at minimum one fortress. The one known fortress contained two gates (north and south), of which the northern gate functioned as the formal entrance to the Peloponessos. The wall was constructed with a rubble and mortar core faced with squared stones. It is not certain how long it took to complete, but the importance given to the task is apparent from the scale of the construction; the Hexamilion is the largest archaeological structure in Greece. Every structure in the region was cannibalized for stone for the effort, either being incorporated into the wall directly, as was the temple of Poseidon at Isthmia, or being burned into lime, as was the sanctuary of Hera at Perachora as well as much of the ancient statuary of Corinth. In the reign of Justinian, the wall was fortified with additional towers, reaching a total number of 153. Military use appears to have fallen off after the 7th century AD, and by the 11th AD domestic structures were being built into the wall. In 1415, the Byzantine emperor Manuel II personally supervised repairs over a period of forty days. The high cost of this effort caused unrest among the local elite. The wall was breached in 1423 and again in 1431 by the Ottomans under the command of Turahan Bey. Despot Constantine Palaiologos restored the wall again in 1444, but the Turks breached it again in 1446 and in October 1452. After the Ottoman conquest of the Peloponnese in 1460, the wall was abandoned. During its history, the wall never succeeded in fulfilling the function for which it was constructed, unless it acted as a deterrent. Elements of the wall are preserved south of the Corinth Canal and at the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia."

 integrated_byz_events.47.d: "Helena Palaiologina (3 February 1428 – 11 April 1458) was a Byzantine princess of the Palaiologos family, who became the Queen consort of Cyprus and Armenia, titular Queen consort of Jerusalem, and Princess of Antioch through her marriage to King John II of Cyprus and Armenia. She was the mother of Queen Charlotte of Cyprus. Helena was largely responsible for the revival of Greek influence in Cyprus due to the numerous members of the Byzantine court who arrived in her wake and were given positions at the Lusignan court. This led to a renewal of ties with the Byzantine Empire. After the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, she welcomed and gave assistance to many Byzantine refugees who had fled to Cyprus. She was described as having been "stronger in character than her husband". She took charge of the kingdom, and her policies in favour of the Orthodox faith and Greek culture enraged the Franks who looked upon her as a dangerous enemy; however she had become far too powerful for them to attack.  Pope Pius II also condemned her for supporting the Orthodox Church, and her endowment of 15,000 ducats per annum to the monastery of Saint George of Mangana also drew much criticism as it was considered to have been "extravagant generosity in impoverished times". The Greek Cypriots, on the other hand, had always revered Helena as a great heroine due to her bold, decisive character in looking after their interests. In 1457, she poisoned her son-in-law, Infante John of Portugal, who had given his support to the Catholic party, thus incurring her wrath and enmity; also she wished for her daughter to marry Louis of Savoy. This second marriage Helena did arrange for her daughter, Charlotte; however, the marriage between Charlotte and Louis took place in 1459, when Helena and King John were both dead, and Charlotte by that time had succeeded her father as Queen Regnant of Cyprus. Helena died on 11 April 1458 in the fortress of Nicosia where she and King John had barricaded themselves during the insurrection of his illegitimate son, James. She was buried in the Royal Monastery of Saint Dominic's. John died the same year, and was succeeded by his only surviving legitimate child, Charlotte."

 integrated_byz_events.48.d: "Constantine XI married twice. The first time was on 1 July 1428 to Theodora Tocco, niece of Carlo I Tocco of Epirus. She died while giving birth to a stillborn daughter in November 1429. His second marriage was on 27 July 1441 to Caterina Gattilusio, daughter of Dorino of Lesbos, who died in August 1442 after suffering a miscarriage. He had no children by either marriage. After his coronation in 1449, Constantine XI sent a commission under George Sphrantzes asking Mara Branković, daughter of the Serbian Despot Đurađ Branković and Byzantine princess Irene Kantakouzene, to marry him. By then Mara was the widow of Murad II; she had been allowed to return to her parents in Serbia after the death of Murad. The proposal was welcomed by her father Đurađ Branković, but it foundered on the objection of Mara herself who had vowed that 'if God ever released her from the hands of the infidel she would lead a life of celibacy and chastity for the rest of her days'. Accordingly, the courtship failed and Sphrantzes took steps to arrange for a marriage with a princess either from the Empire of Trebizond or the Kingdom of Georgia. The choice eventually fell to an unnamed Georgian princess, daughter of George VIII. He started official negotiations with the Georgian king, who had sent an ambassador to Constantinople for that reason. It was agreed that the next spring, Sphrantzes would sail for Georgia to bring the bride to Constantinople, but Constantine's plans were overtaken by the events of 1453."
