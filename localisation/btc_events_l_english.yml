The influence of merchants from other parts of the low countries led to large amounts of Baltic grain being imported through the Danish sound toll towards Amsterdam. Amsterdam grain merchants dominated the Baltic grain trade throughout the period, eventually declining from changes in the Baltic market."

  btc_lc_cities.11.t: "The Center of the Dutch Golden Age"
  btc_lc_cities.11.d: "With the 80 years war raging on throughout the low countries, and the former capital of the United Provinces, Antwerp, occupied and sacked by the Spanish, the choice was made to relocated the capital to Amsterdam.

Amsterdam would receive large amounts of migrant dutch from the Southern Provinces, and replace Antwerp as the new trade capital of the region."

With the Byzantine army in disarray, the nobility scrambling to mantain possession of their holdings and religious and trade disruptions in the entire region, it would appear nothing will be as it was anymore. Many prominent Byzantine intellectuals have fled to Western Europe for safety, while [Root.Monarch.GetName] is crowning his brilliant military campaign by parading through the greatly damaged, but still impressive city."
  btc_misc.1.a:  "The City is Ours!"

  #grand centers of trade

  grand_centers_of_trade.1.t: "The City of [Root.GetCapitalName]"
  grand_centers_of_trade.1.d: "The recent conquest of the Center of Trade of [Root.GetCapitalName] has placed the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ of the city under our control. Without an army to defend it, our garrison could easily loot the city and provide us the cash needed to pay the army from the previous war, allowing us to focus our economical efforts elsewhere. Another point could be made to attempt to forcefully relocate the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ to another of our cities to boost it's influence, and extend our trade power elsewhere. However, establishing [Root.GetCapitalName] as a new trading hub for our [Root.Owner.GovernmentName] could bring in unprecedented amounts of trade income, and make our [Root.Owner.GovernmentName] much richer."

The city of [growing_cot_province.GetCapitalName] has exerted it's trading influence on the surrounding area, and the trade routes have been redrawn to include it. The growth of [growing_cot_province.GetCapitalName] is expected to continue, and it will soon turn into one of if not the major trading hub for the region. Time will only tell if [growing_cot_province.GetCapitalName] will continue its rise."
  grand_centers_of_trade.2.a: "We shall make sure it will not fall."
