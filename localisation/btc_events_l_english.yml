  btc_lc_cities.1.t: "Silting of the Zwin"
  btc_lc_cities.1.d: "The Zwin was a sea arm that secured the city of Brugge's access to the North Sea, allowing merchants to travel to England to buy wool, and to Gascony to buy wine. The city due to it's strategic position on the Rhine."
  btc_lc_cities.1.a: "There is nothing we can do."
  btc_lc_cities.1.b: "Extend the City to the Coast."

  btc_lc_cities.2.t: "Expansion of Brugge"
  btc_lc_cities.2.d: "The extension of the city of Brugge to the coast has been completed, and Brugge has been restored to a part of it's former glory, but the damage has already been done."
  btc_lc_cities.2.a: "We can only hope that the city can recover"

  btc_lc_cities.3.t: "The Scottish Staple"
  btc_lc_cities.3.d: "The Scottish Staple port was established in Brugge as a means of securing an export route for Scottish Wool to the Mainland, but the recent silting of the Zwin has forced us to reconsider the location of the staple."
  btc_lc_cities.3.a: "Move the Staple to Antwerp."
  btc_lc_cities.3.b: "Move the Staple to Amsterdam."

  btc_lc_cities.4.t: "The English Staple"
  btc_lc_cities.4.d: "The recent lost of Calais has meant that the monopoly on wool exports has been disrupted. Something must be done quickly to ensure that the lucrative wool exports can continue."
  btc_lc_cities.4.a: "Move the Staple to Brugge."
  btc_lc_cities.4.b: "Move the Staple to Antwerp."
  btc_lc_cities.4.c: "Move the Staple to Amsterdam."

  btc_lc_cities.5.t: "The fall of the Staple Ports"
  btc_lc_cities.5.d: "The staple ports from Britain to mainland Europe has ensured that large amounts of exports have always reached the mainland. However, a recent trend has begun to favor production in the cities instead of relying on external goods, and a shift to importing raw materials has started."
  btc_lc_cities.5.a: "This shall mean the end of their monopoly on the market"

  btc_lc_cities.6.t: "The Revolt of Flanders"
  btc_lc_cities.6.d: "The recent death of the Duke of Burgundy saw the Duchy of Flanders transfer to us. However, the increased taxes on the Flemish has lead to widespread inflation, with epidemics decimating the population. The Duchy of Flanders have decided to rise up in open revolt against our rule, demanding lowered taxes and have denied us access into their cities for negotiations."
  btc_lc_cities.6.a: "Embargo the cities, and give benefits to those who side with us."

  btc_lc_cities.7.t: "The Colonial Port of the Low Countries"
  btc_lc_cities.7.d: "The establishment of colonies in the New World and the East Indies have increased the demand for goods from Europe to be exported to the colonies, and the demand for metals and textiles among traders traveling the sea route to the Far East has increased. The establishment of trade routes to the Far East has also brought unseen numbers of eastern goods and spices that previously had to take the land route through Germany. Hundreds of ships would pass through daily, and up to 2,000 carts would enter the city each week. Antwerp would soon grown to the second-largest European city north of the Alps."
  btc_lc_cities.7.a: "Antwerp shall be the gateway to Europe."

  btc_lc_cities.8.t: "The Establishment of a Permanent Market"
  btc_lc_cities.8.d: "The colonial boom brought large amounts of trade all season to the port of Antwerp, where previously European ports had to rely on what was in season to import and export goods in large numbers. With the constant increase of demand for more trade to pass through Antwerp, the city soon transitioned from seasonal fairs being held, to an all year market being established in the city to facilitate the transfer and selling of goods for the merchants passing through."
  btc_lc_cities.8.a: "Do we need to expand the market?"

  btc_lc_cities.9.t: "Portuguese Trade"
  btc_lc_cities.9.d: "With the discovery of the East Indies, the demand for metals and textiles for trade among Portuguese traders rose. The port of Antwerp, situated on the Rhine, proved the most logical choice for a location to secure large amounts of European metals and textiles in exchange for goods from the East Indies. Antwerp soon became the trade hub for all Portuguese trade with mainland Europe, and the city soon expanded to include trade from Italy,England,France,Germany and Spain, with local workers processing the large amounts of raw supplies that traveled through the city."
  btc_lc_cities.9.a: "They have made an excellent choice."

  btc_lc_cities.10.t: "Mother of all trades"
  btc_lc_cities.10.d: "The Baltic grain trade in Amsterdam skyrocketed during the 15th and 16th centuries, with the amount of grain imports to Amsterdam rising from less than 20,000 tons in 1480 to 50,000 tons in 1580. The influence of merchants from other parts of the low countries led to large amounts of Baltic grain being imported through the Danish sound toll towards Amsterdam. Amsterdam grain merchants dominated the Baltic grain trade throughout the period, eventually declining from changes in the Baltic market."
  btc_lc_cities.10.a: "Import more grain!"

  btc_lc_cities.11.t: "The Center of the Dutch Golden Age"
  btc_lc_cities.11.d: "With the 80 years war raging on throughout the low countries, and the former capital of the United Provinces, Antwerp, occupied and sacked by the Spanish, the choice was made to relocated the capital to Amsterdam. Antwerp would be retaken a few times, and hostilities would eventually cease, but the Southern Provinces would remain under Spanish control, and the Dutch would limit trade towards the south. Amsterdam would receive large amounts of migrant dutch from the Southern Provinces, and replace Antwerp as the new trade capital of the region."
  btc_lc_cities.11.a: "Amsterdam shall be the new capital for the Dutch."

  btc_lc_cities.12.t: "The migration of the Dutch"
  btc_lc_cities.12.d: "The occupation of the low countries has led to large amounts of persecution among the heretical and heathen populace of the occupied provinces. With the fall of Antwerp, and the establishment of Amsterdam as the new capital, a large scale migration has begun as the heretics and heathens are thrown out of their former homes, and they head towards the new capital of the United Provinces."
  btc_lc_cities.12.a: "They shall be welcome."

  btc_lc_cities.13.t: "Sack of Antwerp"
  btc_lc_cities.13.d: "With the trade capital of the United Provinces under our control, victory seems likely against the rebels. However, the distance between the low countries and our homeland has led to a slight delay in payments to the troops. Rumors have spread of the troops gathering forces to loot the city, and if their pay does not reach in-time, Antwerp may be reduced to ashes."
  btc_lc_cities.13.a: "Sack the city."
  btc_lc_cities.13.b: "Make an effort to pay the troops."

  #Languages of italy

  flavor_ita.1.t: "A question of Identity"
  flavor_ita.1.d: "As we are solidifying our claims on the Italian peninsula and striving to become the most important nation in the region, culturally and politically, the time has come to settle an issue many have brought up. Our peninsula has an extremely rich cultural tradition, with many notable works produced by poets, philosophers, scholars, kings and bishops, from Sicily to Piedmont. However, by far the most important centres of Italian cultures are in the middle of the peninsula: from Rome to Florence, with authors like Dante Alighieri or Niccolò Machiavelli, the cultural legacy of central Italy is unparalleled. Our nation however hails from the more distant $CAPITAL$, and we still proudly follow our [Root.Culture.GetName] traditions, as we should. However, some are suggesting that by switching over to the more renowned Tuscan language, we could more easily spread and adapt it to the rest of the Italian people that are coming under our rule, to better harmonize our state apparatus with their own and to become the representatives and true heirs of the cultural legacy of central Italy. Whilst this may cause unhappiness among certain circles back at home, the benefits will likely outweigh the cost. What shall we do?"
  flavor_ita.1.a: "We are not merely [Root.Culture.GetName], we are Italian!"
  flavor_ita.1.b: "We must stay true to our roots."
  flavor_ita.1.a.tt: "All provinces of §Y[Root.Culture.GetName]§! culture get §Y'Upset the locals'§!, giving the following effects:\nLocal Unrest: §R+5.00§!"

  #Marble in Massa events

  PriceChangesBTC.1.title:0 "The Massa Marble"
  PriceChangesBTC.1.desc:0 "Europe is experiencing an increased interest in the revival of Classical Antiquity art. Artists are looking upon creating expressive, dynamic and beautiful figures made of marble stone. A quarry in Massa, producer of a famous high-quality marble since ancient Roman times known as Luni Marble, has recently seen a huge increase in demand for the endless new projects on statuary and architecture. There seems no end in artists coming and ordering stone. Marble is now pink gold."
  PriceChangesBTC.1.a:0 "I shall order Massa marble myself!"
  PriceChangesBTC.2.title:0 "Cybo and Malaspina families"
  PriceChangesBTC.2.desc:0 "Coming the 17th century, the Cybo and Malaspina families, rulers over the Massa-Carrara region, decided to make Massa a city worthy of an Italian country's capital. Following the bigger importance of the city in a regional level and the increasing demand of the famous Luni Marble of Carrara for renaissance art and building projects, the family created the "Office of Marble" in 1564 to regulate the marble mining industry. Despite the cradle of anarchism Carrara became centuries among the quarry workers, these new regulations and prices seem to be working, and the cost of high-quality marble will only increase for the foreseeable future."
  PriceChangesBTC.2.a:0 "I'm glad I bought the marble earlier!"
  PriceChangesBTC.3.title:0 "Interest for Renaissance art declines"
  PriceChangesBTC.3.desc:0 "For almost three centuries Europe experienced an increased interest in the revival of Classical Antiquity art, popularising concepts such as antropocentrism and individualism. Following the religious turmoil of the 16th century, darker religious themes and styles were emphatised once again like the chiaroscuro, or light dark. Although breath-taking sculptures are still being made and renaissance architecture is still notable, this wonderful art is decaying again to give birth to new, more dramatic and exaggerated expressions of art, such as mannerism, to represent a ravaged by war and religiously divided society."
  PriceChangesBTC.3.a:0 "Sculptures are passé, paint me $CAPITAL_CITY$!"
  
  #Potato events
  btc_tradegoods.2.t: "Spread of the Potato to Europe"
  btc_tradegoods.2.d: "In the 16th century as a result of the Columbian Exchange, several new plants were introduced to Europe, chiefly among them was the potato. The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners to territories and ports throughout the world. For the Europeans the potato was regarded as a food for the natives and many thought it was poisonous: the conquistadors speak most favourably of the potato but they recommend it especially for the natives who have to do the heaviest jobs. A similar pattern is to be found in England where the potato became be the food of the working class. Thus, the potato was slow to be adopted by European farmers, but soon enough it became an important food staple and field crop that played a major role in the European 19th century population boom."
  btc_tradegoods.2.a: "The Canary Islands shall be the transit port for this new good."
  btc_tradegoods.2.b: "Significant advances in agriculture are ahead of us."

  btc_tradegoods.3.t: "Potatoes spread to $PROVINCENAME$"
  btc_tradegoods.3.d: "In an effort to increase productivity the local farmers of $PROVINCE$ have increasingly turned to an exotic foreign good: the potato. Though originally considered to be a poisonous plant only useful for animal fodder, the speed and quantity at which this plant is grown impressed the farmers who have added the potato as a vital component of the province's crop rotation."
  btc_tradegoods.3.a: "Ok."
  
  #Fall of Constantinople

  btc_misc.1.t: "Constantinople has fallen!"
  btc_misc.1.d: "The great city, capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, has withstood several sieges and has only been conquered once in its long history, but the newest defeat at the hands of [Root.GetName] represents a turning point in the history of the city and Europe as a whole. With the Byzantine army in disarray, the nobility scrambling to maintain possession of their holdings and religious turmoil in the entire region, it would appear nothing will be as it was anymore. Many prominent Byzantine intellectuals have fled to Western Europe for safety, while [Root.Monarch.GetName] is crowning [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] brilliant military campaign by parading through the damaged, but still impressive city."
  btc_misc.1.a:  "The City is Ours!"

  #Orban events

  pitirr_btc_events.1.d: "My Basileus, a mysterious engineer claiming to be of Hungarian ancestry came to $CAPITAL_CITY$ recently and offered us his services. He claims he can create a supergun, one that could breach the unstoppable walls of Constantinople. Having him serve would be a great opportunity to challenge the Ottoman horde, however he demands a fairly high payment for his project. What shall we do?"
  pitirr_btc_events.1.a: "We can't afford his services."

  pitirr_btc_events.2.d: "My sultan, a mysterious engineer claiming to be of Hungarian ancerstry came to $CAPITAL_CITY$ recently. He claims he can construct a cannon that would blast the walls of Konstantiniyye handful of shots. Orban also says the Byzantines declined his offer. This may indicate they cannot afford foreign services. Allah smiles upon Your plans! Shall we hire him?"
  pitirr_btc_events.2.a: "We don't need him."

  grand_centers_of_trade.1.d: "The recent conquest of the Center of Trade of [Root.GetCapitalName] has placed the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ of the city under our control. Without an army to defend it, our garrison could easily loot the city and provide us the cash needed to pay the army from the previous war, allowing us to focus our economical efforts elsewhere. Another point could be made to attempt to forcefully relocate the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ to another of our cities to boost it's influence, and extend our trade power elsewhere. However, establishing [Root.GetCapitalName] as a new trading hub for our [Root.Owner.GovernmentName] could bring in unprecedented amounts of trade income, and make our [Root.Owner.GovernmentName] much richer."
  grand_centers_of_trade.1.a: "Raze [Root.GetCapitalName] to the ground."
  grand_centers_of_trade.1.b: "Relocate the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$!"

The city of [growing_cot_province.GetCapitalName] has exerted it's trading influence on the surrounding area, and the trade routes have been redrawn to include it.

  flavor_kor.EVTDESC7:0 "Sericulture was encouraged from the early days of the Joseon dynasty, with the publication of a “Commentary on Sericulture” in the fourth year of King Sejo’s reign. In this period, patterns of Chinese characters were often used, as well as patterns of clouds and flowers. These were designed not solely for their aesthetic appeal, but from Confucian ideals, and a pragmatic wish to encourage good fortune. Wool rugs and carpets were also produced in quantity for export to Japan, and pattern dyed “chintz” also became popular during the Joseon dynasty. Originating in India, it became fashionable in China and Korea, where it was known as hua-po."

  #Edict of Moulins
  edict_moulins.1.t:0 "The Edict of Moulins"
  edict_moulins.1.d:0 "Since the middle ages, France has divided her territory through 'appanages'; a series of titles, offices, estates or other things of value granted to the younger males of the ruling family, known as princes, who would otherwise have no inheritance under the system of primogeniture, where the firstborn inherits his parent's entire estate.\n\nMany problems arise from this system with provinces becoming highly autonomous or de facto independent, some of them becoming very powerful on their own and even waging war against France or openly allying France's enemies. One example of this is the case of the duchy of Burgundy, title ceded by Henry I to his brother Robert I. Many french kings, like Charles V, tried to remove the appanage system and hold a tighter grip in their domains, but in vain.\n\nIn 1566 an important royal ordinance was issued in Moulins under Charles IX, receiving the name of the Edict of Moulins. This ordinance dealt with many aspects of the administration of justice and feudal and ecclesiastical privilege, abrogation of the levy of rights of tallage claimed by seigneurs over their dependants and provisions for a system of concessions on rivers. This edict also declared that the royal domain could not be alienated except in a couple exceptional cases, such as the creation of an appanage, which must return to the crown in its original state on the extinction of the male line. Therefore the apanagist could not separate himself from his appanage in any way.\n\nWhile this medieval system was not completely removed until the french revolution in the late 18th century, this edict greatly reduced its influence on how French monarchs administrated their land and reduced the princes' influence over the royal domain considerably."
