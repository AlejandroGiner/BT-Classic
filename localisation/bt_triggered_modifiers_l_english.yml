 bt_triggered_modifier_a_big_family:0 "Feudal Remnants"
 desc_bt_triggered_modifier_a_big_family:0 "This polity still holds some legal and bureaucratic remnants of previous centuries' nation and government structure, ruling over some autonomous subjects. This division of holding of land in exchange for service and labour is mildly easy to manage."

 bt_iberian_crowns:0 "Crown of Aragon"
 desc_bt_iberian_crowns:0 "Over the course of the late Middle Ages and in the wake of the Reconquista, the Crown of Aragon evolved into a composite monarchy, essentially multiple different de-facto independent states falling under the same ruler. The great autonomy and minimal forced integration proved unoffensive to most and sytem was stable enough that Aragon, a comperably poor and rural microstate, was able to rule over a union of a nearly a dozen other kingdoms."
