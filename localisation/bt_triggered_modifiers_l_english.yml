 bt_iberian_crowns:0 "Crown of Aragon"
 desc_bt_iberian_crowns:0 "Over the course of the late Middle Ages and in the wake of the Reconquista, the Crown of Aragon evolved into a composite monarchy, essentially multiple different de-facto independent states falling under the same ruler. The great autonomy and minimal forced integration proved unoffensive to most and sytem was stable enough that Aragon, a comperably poor and rural microstate, was able to rule over a union of a nearly a dozen other kingdoms."
