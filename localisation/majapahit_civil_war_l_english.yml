 maj_civil_war.1.t: "Majapahit Civil War"
 maj_civil_war.1.d: "Ever since the Paregreg War, the Majapahit Empire was always in constant decline. With the loss of subjects overseas, a constantly empty treasury, and increasingly powerful Muslim merchants in the north, it is unlikely that the Majapahit State will stay intact for much longer."

 maj_civil_war.100.t: "The End of the Civil War"

 maj_civil_war.2.t: "Muslim Merchants Supplying Rebels"
 maj_civil_war.2.d: "Through our nation, it is widely known that Muslim merchants are some of the most powerful people in the region, even sometimes being more powerful than our own King, and according to some sources, these powerful men may be the ones supplying separatists and rebels in our country. We must take action against these traitors."
 maj_civil_war.2.a: "We cannot do anything!"
 maj_civil_war.2.b: "Publicly denounce the merchants"
 
 maj_civil_war.3.t: "Muslims Threaten to Break with the Crown"
 maj_civil_war.3.d: "Unsatisfied with regional representation, some of the large Muslim minorities in our country have begun to break away from us and form their own nation. As revolts intensify across Majapahit, the question begs whether we should continue to clash with these rebels, or submit to their demands."
 maj_civil_war.3.a: "Crush them!"
 maj_civil_war.3.b: "Grant them autonomy"
 
 maj_civil_war.4.t: "Demak Declares Independence"
 maj_civil_war.4.d: "With our nation in shambles over the current civil war, the Muslim port city of Demak has declared independence. Our control over the city is now void, and the people of Demak are completely free from our rule."
 maj_civil_war.4.a: "We cannot do anything!"
 maj_civil_war.4.b: "Demak is ours!"
 
 maj_civil_war.5.t: "Local Adipati Secedes"

 maj_civil_war.5.b: "Their disobedience will not be tolerated"
 
 maj_civil_war.6.t: "Province Breaks Away"

 maj_civil_war.7.t: "Majapahit Left Kingless"

 maj_civil_war.7.a: "The end is upon us!"
 
 maj_civil_war.8.t: "Pretender Claims the Throne"
 maj_civil_war.8.d: "A distant relative of the royal dynasty has sought to use this period of turmoil to make his own bid for the Majapahit throne. Using all in his powers, he has gathered an army, and has set up a base in his home province."
 maj_civil_war.8.a: "Off with his head!"
