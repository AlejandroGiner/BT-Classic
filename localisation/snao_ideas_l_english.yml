 SYR_ideas: "Syrian Ideas"
 SYR_ideas_start: "Syrian Traditions"
 SYR_ideas_bonus: "Syrian Ambition"
 SYR_ancient_history: "Ancient History"
 SYR_ancient_history_desc: "The region where Syria inhabits has been a haven for ancient cultures. The Phoenicians, the Canaanites, the Egyptians at one point, the Greeks at other points, so many people have lent their knowledge and legacy to the Syrian people over the years that we would be fools not to use them to our advantage today."
 SYR_levantine_value: "Levantine Value"
 SYR_levantine_value_desc: "The great value present within the Levant is not secret to those from Europe, Persia, Arabia, North Africa, and many other places. With Syria in a prime position to take hold of the entirety of the Levant, we are set to be in a prime position for negotiations in the future. Access to the Levant is key not just for trade, but for some religions as well."
 SYR_rashidun_umayyad_abbasid_caliphates: "The Caliphates"
 SYR_rashidun_umayyad_abbasid_caliphates_desc: "From the Rashidun to the Umayyad to the Abbasid Caliphate, Syrian land has been the subject of Islamic conquest and integration for several centuries now. It is through the Caliphates and the intermediate powers that came between them and after them that Syria has learned to fight and become a force to be reckoned with."
 SYR_crusader_memories: "Crusader Memories"
 SYR_crusader_memories_desc: "The crusades of centuries past left a considerable mark upon Syrian history. The bastions they built up along with the conflicts they fought in the Levant and on Syrian land are remembered well by our people, but our people would be fools to only tell the tales of the crusades and not learn from them. Using what they left behind and engineering tight and sound defensive structures like they did will allow us to withstand invasion after invasion."
 SYR_internal_cohesion: "Internal Cohesion"
 SYR_internal_cohesion_desc: "Various tensions within Syria pull at the edges, seeking to stretch it to its breaking point. Whether it is ethnic unrest, religious strife, or possibly even monetary trouble, Syria must remain cohesive and ready to handle these problems as they come along."
 SYR_ethnicities_in_and_around_syria: "People Groups of Syria"
 SYR_ethnicities_in_and_around_syria_desc: "There are several people coming and going from Syria, some whom choose to settle in the land. They bring their culture, language, and traditions to Syria and as such also bring in bouts of tension at times as their interests may conflict with Syrian interests. We must, over time, learn to accept these new people as our own and to integrate them into Syria so that we may flourish without worry."
 SYR_syria_as_a_nation: "The Nation of Syria"
 SYR_syria_as_a_nation_desc: "A unified Syrian nation is a dream many administrators of ours have. The royalty, the nobility, and even a good portion of the peasants have come to us with lofty goals of living in a strong and secure Syrian nation, but do we have the resources to make this dream a reality? If we do not have it internally, we must take it from external sources, and for that, we will form a better and larger military."
 
 IRQ_ideas: "Iraqi Ideas"
 IRQ_ideas_start: "Iraqi Traditions"
 IRQ_ideas_bouns: "Iraqi Ambition"
 IRQ_defense_of_mesopotamia: "Defend Mesopotamia"
 IRQ_defense_of_mesopotamia_desc: "The value in Mesopotamia is vast and great and most every person in the regions around us know this very well. As such, they will be striving to subjugate Iraqi lands in any way they can, keeping the resources harvested from here for themselves. Thus, it is our mission to defend the land to our greatest ability and to fortify ourselves against all threats, rising to the challenge of invasions whenever they occur."
 IRQ_cradle_of_great_cities: "Cradle of Great Cities"
 IRQ_cradle_of_great_cities_desc: "The great ancient cities like Assur and Babylonia still retain remnants in Mesopotamia, despite them being faint as of today. Our preservation and respect for them, however, had led us to them being visited more often and our nation being regarded as a keeper of the past and one that learns from its previous mistakes and builds upon them to make a better and brighter future."
 IRQ_fortify_iraqi_lands: "Fortify Iraqi Lands"
 IRQ_fortify_iraqi_lands_desc: "The lands of Iraq are open and offer plenty of routes into and out of their streets and pathways. It is in our best interest to see these places better defended and better built in terms of their defensive status, so as to deter invaders from coming through."
 IRQ_persian_influences: "Persian Influences"
 IRQ_persian_influences_desc: "The Persians beyond the mountains to our east have often been in contact with the people of Iraq and often times they bring with them great ideas and trade opportunities. Perhaps recruiting more into our court could elevate it to a higher standard than before? It is well worth a try since our predecessors have and they too prospered from it."
 IRQ_trade_links_of_mesopotamia: "Trade Links of Mesopotamia"
 IRQ_trade_links_of_mesopotamia_desc: "Trade flows in and out of Mesopotamia regularly and it is quite prosperous on its own. By taking it into our own hands more so than before and inserting our influence where possible, we will profit from Mesopotamian trade routes at an unprecedented rate."
 IRQ_establish_military_framework: "Establish Military Framework"
 IRQ_establish_military_framework_desc: "In order to keep Iraq from sinking into the past of military history, we will need to design a proper military framework that we can follow and possibly reform in the future. By doing so, Iraq will be able to keep itself up-to-date with the latest in military thought and strategy and will not be so easily subdued by others."
 IRQ_behold_al_iraq: "Behold, al-Iraq"
 IRQ_behold_al_iraq_desc: "Before, there was little hope of a true Iraqi nation. But with our strength and skill, we are well on the way toward providing a safe haven for people who consider themselves 'Iraqi' and who want to see a prospering and grand Iraqi nation. Let us continue to work toward this goal, despite what seeks to hold us back."
 
 PLS_ideas:0 "Palestinian Ideas"
 PLS_ideas_start:0 "Palestinian Traditions"
 PLS_ideas_bonus:0 "Palestinian Ambition"
 PLS_independent_palestine:0 "Independence of Palestine"
 PLS_independent_palestine_desc:0 "Our land has been under control of tribes, Kingdoms Empires, Caliphates, but finally, authority rests firmly in our hands, and it is our moment to shine in history and ensure Palestine's continued prestige in the Levant. To do that, we need to mantain a strong standing army that will turn all would-be conquerors back in shame!"
 PLS_holy_land:0 "Holy Land"
 PLS_holy_land_desc:0 "Our country holds within its borders the most sacred land on the planet, the land of milk and honey. It has been under the occupation of many powerful empires in the region, but now that we are independent, the people who have lived here for generations feel more secure in having their rights respected."
 PLS_natural_beauty:0 "Natural Beauty"
 PLS_natural_beauty_desc:0 "Since antiquity Palestine has been known as a place of exceptional natural wealth and beauty. People come from all over the world just to see this land, with its geographical variety, we have lot to learn from the place we call home."
 PLS_taxation_policies:0 "Taxation Policies"
 PLS_taxation_policies_desc:0 "There are people of many faiths and profession in our nation. From artisans to merchants, from bankers to scholars, there is much wealth that they can give to us, in more ways than one."
 PLS_dead_sea:0 "The Dead Sea"
 PLS_dead_sea_desc:0 "The Dead sea is of high importance to all Abrahamic religions, and even non-Abrahamic religions recognised its power, power that they attributed to magic."
 PLS_trade_crossroads:0 "Trade Crossroads"
 PLS_trade_crossroads_desc:0 "Connecting the Levant with Egypt, Palestine is an extremely important trade route. Many expensive, luxurious goods pass through here, and it is of extreme importance that we focus our efforts into controlling trade in the region."
 PLS_defend_the_merchants:0 "Defend the Merchants"
 PLS_defend_the_merchants_desc:0 "As our influence in the Mediterranean grows, we must have capable divisions of light ships in order to protect our merchants from foreign harassment. These skills will also be very important in our continued importance in the seas."
 
 YZD_ideas: "Yazdi Ideas"
 YZD_ideas_start: "Yazdi Traditions"
 YZD_ideas_bonus: "Yazdi Ambition"
 YZD_zoroastrian_legacy: "Zoroastrian Legacy"
 YZD_zoroastrian_legacy_desc: "The pious nature of the Yazdi people has been known since the time of the Sassanids. Though faiths change over time, the effort our people put into making their faith as true and as great as can be can be seen when Zoroastrianism was still dominant in Persia. Using these old traditions, we will ensure that our faith today shines as brightly as it did before."
 YZD_difficulties_of_yazd: "The Difficulties of Yazd"
 YZD_difficulties_of_yazd_desc: "Yazd is not only a difficult place to live, but it is also a difficult place to fight inside of. The isolated parts of it harbor safe passage and resources, but other those parts, people are subject to the elements around them. It is through these difficulties that we have learned to hone our shock-based desert tactics, and when we need to fight oustide of Yazd, we will be sure to adapt these tactics to the different envrironments."
 YZD_capital_of_the_muzaffarid_dynasty: "Former Capital of the Muzaffarid Dynasty"
 YZD_capital_of_the_muzaffarid_dynasty_desc: "The Muzaffarid Dynasty may have had but a brief life in Persia, but they had their capital at one point stationed in Yazd itself. Though we can only speculate as to why they did so, one likely reason is due to the defensive nature of Yazd itself. Compounding upon this defensive mentality in our other lands will help us withstand future invasion from foreign rivals."
 YZD_haven_in_persia: "Haven in Persia"
 YZD_haven_in_persia_desc: "For a long time now, we've been known as a safe haven for Persians everywhere who are fleeing persecution or are in need of respite. Yazd may be unforgiving to the invader seeking harm, but it is welcoming to those that see it as a fellow family member of the Persian region. With this in mind, expanding outwards will be less of any issue if we continue this policy of being a safe haven for Persian people."
 YZD_silk_weaving_industry: "Silk Weaving Industry"
 YZD_silk_weaving_industry_desc: "A commodity and wondrous material, silk, is readily produced in Yazd and its patterns and production are unique to Yazd itself (or so some say). We'd prefer to keep this silk production going as strong as possible, but to also not overwhelm our people with it, so we will need to balance out how production of it will scale in the future."
 YZD_sassanian_roots: "Sassanian Roots"
 YZD_sassanian_roots_desc: "Yazd itself is named after the Shahanshah of the Sassanid Empire, Yazdegerd I. Throughout the times from the Sassanid Empire onwards, Yazd has been known as a sort of memorial or legacy place that the Sassanids left behind in their wake, and with that legitimacy backing us, we can be sure that people from around Persia will support our authority."
 YZD_uniting_persia: "Uniting Persia"
 YZD_uniting_persia_desc: "The pieces of Persia lay scattered and divided, fighting for dominance after the fall of Timur and in the face of threats from the north, west, and the east. However hard of a goal it might be to reach, the ambition to unite Persia once more under a single dynasty that is stable and righteous is what Yazd is set out to do. Time will tell if our ambition is to be fulfilled."
 

 BAR_ideas: "Barrois Ideas"
 BAR_ideas_start: "Barrois Traditions"
 BAR_ideas_bonus: "Barrois Ambition"
 sophias_power: "Sophie, Countess of Bar"
 sophias_power_desc: "From 1033 to 1093, after the death of Frederick III, Duke of Upper Lorraine, the cunning and grand Countess of Bar, Sophie, expanded the territory of Bar through various methods of political and diplomatic intrigue along with conquest and purchase. Even her descendants continued this path of expansion and brought Bar to grand prominence as a de facto independent border state betwixt the Germans and the French people. It is because of her that we owe our existence and fortune."
 french_politics_over_german_politics: "French Politics over German Politics"
 french_politics_over_german_politics_desc: "In deciding which side of the fence we'd be on, our French lineage dictated that we side with and become entrenched in French politics over German politics. As such, centuries of intermarriage and intrigue followed our choice and we have been quite prominent in our time within the French region."
 a_peer_of_france: "A Peer of France"
 a_peer_of_france_desc: "A title bestowed upon nobles of distinction in the French region, the Count of Bar was recognized as one in 1354, leading it to become even more influential throughout French lands. Those who know how much power we wield and how firm our authority is will yield to us more easily, thanks in part to this prestigious title."
 ties_to_lorraine: "Ties to Lorraine"
 ties_to_lorraine_desc: "From the outset, the Duchy of Bar has been undoubtedly tied to Lorraine and its rulers. Though they may be different from us in various ways, the marriages and links between Bar and Lorraine are key and have helped ready our administration to take on different diplomatic affairs, both inside and outside of the French region."
 using_the_status_of_duchy: "Use the status of 'Duchy'"
 using_the_status_of_duchy_desc: "Being a duchy carries weight when speaking to others in the French region and even those in neighboring regions. If we can cultivate the title and keep it legitimately tied to Bar and the Barrois people, we will be able to garner wider support within our own realm itself."
 fortify_the_lands_of_bar: "Fortify the Lands of Bar"
 fortify_the_lands_of_bar_desc: "Being initially a border state of sorts has had a inherent defensive affect on us. We have learned to defend ourselves first, before taking to attacking others, and this defenisve mentality must be promoted over time if Barrois land is to remain safe and secure. Better defensive measures will be found and implemented; the walls and garrisons of Bar will not go down without a fight fit for the ages."
 all_for_france: "All for France"
 all_for_france_desc: "Despite the differences between the various counties and provinces of the French region, we find more alike between ourselves than with any other culture outside of the French region. There must be a unifying force between the French people, a single polity that can seize the mantle of power and signify true dominance over the region, and we will see to it that we do our best to ensure that it is us."
