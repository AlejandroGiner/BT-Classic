  btc_georgian_civil_war.1.d: "King [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Georgia has overstepped [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] authority. The once mighty kingdom has been greatly weakened by foreign incursions and internal divisions. Some of the kingdom's regions had achieved significant autonomy over the years and [Root.Monarch.GetName] was determined to bring the crown's recalcitrant subjects under control. In doing so he arrested some of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] most powerful nobles without any real justification, which in the end, has only alienated the local rulers even further. Now, they have made their move. As more and more former eristavi rise up against the central government, it remains to be seen whether the kingdom will recover from its ills or will succumb and be carved up by its increasingly hostile neighbors."

But on this day, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for the first time in many years, feels confident in exiting [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] fortress and surveying [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] realm. Or what remains of it."
