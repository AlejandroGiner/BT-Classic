 #COPTIC -> ORIENTAL
 coptic:0 "Oriental"
 coptic_religion_desc:1 "Oriental Orthodoxy is a branch of Christendom that follow the Alexandrine rite and who answer to the Patriarch in Alexandria.\nWith the fall of Egypt to the Muslims hundreds of years ago the Patriarch is controlled by a Non-Christian state with the Oriental Orthodox religion surviving as the majority faith only in Ethiopia and Nubia."
 religious_events.EVTDESC1:0 "Our tolerant religious policy seems to have led to unwanted results. It seems that some of our people have decided to embrace the Oriental Orthodox faith."
 religious_events.18.c:0 "We must send word to the Oriental Orthodox Patriarch."
 tengri_events.38.d:0 "Used to acting far away from the Patriarch of their church the Oriental Orthodox Monastic Orders have quickly made themselves at home in our lands. They are now growing in numbers and influence, especially in the frontier regions under our control. Under ideal circumstances the orders stand ready to move into a newly conquered region, establishing new monasteries, quickly stabilizing and converting the region to their faith. Our Shamans are alarmed at this practice as they feel they should be the ones to welcome our new subjects rather than these foreign Monks."
 coptic_flavor.2.d:0 "The ancient city of Aksum rests safely in Oriental Orthodox hands. Once it was the heart of the ancient Aksumite Empire, a bastion of Christian power, situated at the crossroads of Africa, Arabia and the Greco-Roman world. Among the obelisks and palace [From.GetName] is rebuilding the churches of this mighty nation of old.\n\nThe greatest of them all is the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion. It is the place where the Ethiopian Emperors have been crowned, the descendants of Menelik I, who was the son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. It is here he brought the Ark of the Covenant. Every year, thousands of pilgrims come to visit this holy place."
 coptic_flavor.3.d:0 "Rejoice, the holy city of Alexandria is once more under Oriental Orthodox rule! The historical seat of our sacred Church has been liberated.\n\nAlexandria is an ancient and proud city, founded by Alexander the Great. Many of humanity's brightest minds have called her their home. For many hundred years the scholars of Alexandria studied and taught at The Great Library, which was followed by the Catechetical School of Alexandria, first in the world of its kind. In the years to come we will restore the sacred halls of knowledge and produce some of the finest theologians the world has ever known."
 coptic_flavor.4.d:0 "Rejoice, the holy city of Alexandria is once more under Oriental Orthodox rule! The historical seat of our sacred Church has been liberated by [From.GetName].\n\nAlexandria is an ancient and proud city, founded by Alexander the Great. Many of humanity's brightest minds have called her their home. For many hundred years the scholars of Alexandria studied and taught at The Great Library, which was followed by the Catechetical School of Alexandria, first in the world of its kind. In the years to come her sacred halls of knowledge will be restored and come to produce some of the finest theologians the world has ever known."
 coptic_flavor.6.d:0 "Yerevan has been liberated by our fellow Oriental Orthodox nation [From.GetName]! In the early 4th century the sacred Etchmiadzin Cathedral was built there. For many years the cathedral has been the national and political center of the stateless Armenian people. Throughout centuries of war and loss they have found strength and the will to keep on fighting in her loving embrace. Now she will be restore her to her former glory!"
 coptic_flavor.10.d:0 "Glory to the Lord, Qasr Ibrim belongs to the Oriental Orthodox [From.GovernmentName] of [From.GetName]! For many years this great Christian city has persevered, even though surrounded by religious enemies on all sides. Perched atop a cliff by the mighty Nile, Qasr Ibrim has remained a bastion of Christianity in Lower Nubia even as the rest of the region fell into darkness. Now [From.GetName] will utilize the city's great political and economic resources to spread the word of the one true God throughout Nubia."
 coptic_flavor.40.d:0 "The Oriental orthodox religion has long had a presence in [cairo_province.GetName]. Some of the Patriarch's followers abroad have even claimed that we are keeping Copts captive in our lands... Perhaps they need a reminder of the situation?"
 coptic_flavor.34.d:0 "A party of Oriental Orthodox diplomats from our neighbor [From.GetName] have crossed into our territory. They have an unusually large number of priests among them. Our advisors suspect that they are trying to make contact with other Christians to the north. The diplomats are worryingly tight-lipped on the subject of their purpose. Perhaps it is simply a religious matter, but what if they are attempting to gather allies against us? We would be beset on multiple fronts by fanatical infidels!"
 
 #CATHOLIC
 catholic_religion_desc:1 "Catholicism is the name of a Christian tradition with its roots in the old Latin rite that recognizes the Pope as the head of Christendom.\nIn 1444 Catholicism is the dominant Christian Church in western and northern Europe but it will likely be broken up by Lutheranism and Calvinism during the reformation."
 
 #PROTESTANT -> LUTHERAN
 protestant:0 "Lutheran"
 protestant_religion_desc:1 "Lutheranism is a major branch of western Christianity that identifies with the teaching of Martin Luther, a 16th century German reformer. Luther's efforts to reform the theology and practice of the church launched the Protestant Reformation. The reaction of the government and church authorities to the international spread of his writings, beginning with the 95 Theses, divided Western Christianity. Luther sought to reform the Western Church to what he considered a more biblical foundation, going against a number of the conventions that over time have developed in the Catholic church and even going against the idea of a pope itself. Unlike Calvinism, Lutherans retain many of the liturgical practices and sacramental teachings of the pre-Reformation Church, with a particular emphasis on the Eucharist, or Lord's Supper. Lutheran theology differs from Reformed theology in Christology, divine grace, the purpose of God's Law, the concept of perseverance of the saints, and predestination.\nIn the game Lutheranism will take hold in Europe starting from the 16th century and covers mainly countries inspired by Luther's teachings and who have formed state churches as well as minor related Protestant groups."

 HRE_RELIGIOUS_WAR_DESC:0 "The Holy Roman Empire is in a state of Religious War between the Catholic and Lutheran faiths. During a Religious War, the Lutheran and Catholic Leagues are available to be joined. The League that does not follow the dominant faith in the Empire may declare war on the Emperor to attempt to change the Empire's dominant faith."

 HRE_LEAGUES_DISABLED:0 "The §YLutheran§! and §YCatholic§! Leagues are NOT enabled."
 religious_leagues.2.d:0 "The War of Religion in the Empire has ended in victory for the Evangelical Union. The Emperor has been forced to abdicate and Lutheranism is now the dominant faith in the Empire."
 religious_leagues.7.d:0 "With the failure of the Catholic League to successfully challenge the Emperor, the Imperial Parliament has convened in a Diet to proclaim Lutheranism as the sole confessional faith of the Holy Roman Empire. Electors who follow a different confession will be stripped of their privileges, and the Emperor is given broad authority to enforce Lutheran unity within the Empire."
 religious_leagues.8.d:0 "The War of Religion in the Empire has ended in total victory for the Emperor and the Imperial Parliament has convened in a Diet to proclaim Lutheranism as the sole confessional faith of the Holy Roman Empire. Electors who follow a different confession will be stripped of their privileges, and the Emperor is given broad authority to enforce Lutheran unity within the Empire."
 hre_dominant_protestant:0 "Lutheran Empire"
 desc_hre_dominant_protestant:0 "The Lutheran faith is the official religion of the Holy Roman Empire. Following this faith grants our nation a certain moral legitimacy."
 protestantism_events.7.d:0 "Religious fervor has gripped [Root.GetName] as the population have become convinced the end of days is drawing nearer. Peasants are talking of signs in the sky and contrary to the doctrine of the State Church local priests are giving sermons on the apocalypse. As Millenarianism sweeps the province blame is being put on the State and State Church itself which professes to be Lutheran yet clearly is not living up to its name.\nOfficial reactions have so far been very weak as even among the clergy of [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] some feel these fears are justified."
 protestantism_events.15.d:0 "It is no secret that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a great understanding of the Catholic faith, perhaps much more so than the clergy in our State Church would wish. Nonetheless [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] coronation has been a popular event and the people seem to be behind our new ruler. Undoubtedly an understanding of foreign faiths may be of good use to a ruler of a Lutheran Kingdom and few would dare accuse [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Crypto-Catholicism."
 protestantism_events.23.d:0 "As Christendom grows ever more divided the trickle of religious refugees has grown into a steady stream. Religious conflicts in major Catholic states have caused many Protestant to leave their old home countries. As a Lutheran country with our own Church we would be able to offer them protection and we could also make good use of their skills and assets.\nProtestantism is, however, far from a unified faith and it is not very likely that all those who come to us will find the Church of [Root.GetName] to match their own beliefs fully. While it would be admirable to receive all Protestant Immigrants it might be more prudent to hand pick those that possess skills we could make good use of."
 protestantism_events.23.b:0 "Only receive the Lutherans."
 protestantism_events.27.d:0 "An unusual man has recently emerged from the education system of the Church of [Root.GetName]. He is a priest of unusual charisma and conviction yet instead of desiring to change the Church in accordance to his convictions he is determined to instill the value of keeping with the Lutheran traditions and dogmas of the State Church.\nThis is an unusual man in times like these and we could undoubtedly put him to good use."
 protestantism_events.29.b:0 "This will help bring us closer to other Lutherans."
 protestantism_events.29.b.tt:0 "Relation to all §YCatholic§! countries decreased by §R35§!.\nRelation with all §YLutheran§! countries increased by §G35§!.\nThese effects will dissipate over the next 12 years."

 protestant_ideal:0 "Ideal Lutheran Country"
 protestantism_events.36.d:0 "Due to our motherland's policy of sending religious heretics to the colonies a wide variety of different faiths can be found in our settlements. While they could all be said to be protestant in some form or another they have views that are often starkly opposed to each other on many issues. The province of [Root.GetName] has been settled by large numbers of two theologically opposed churches, one stands closer to the Calvinist churches of Europe, while the other stands closer to the Lutheran Churches. Both are, however, just as opposed to the control of the State Church they have left behind. Tensions are running high and it may be best to step in now to keep them apart before things escalate."
 protestantism_events.36.b:0 "Convince the Calvinist party to move to other lands."
 protestantism_events.36.c:0 "Convince the Lutheran party to move to other lands."
 EST_VAL_PROTESTANT:0 "Lutheran: §Y$VAL$%§!"
 tengri_events.57.d:1 "Eager for all our subjects to be able to read and interpret the word of God themselves the Lutheran priests of our country are seeking our support for creating a new Bible translation. They claim the new translation will bring our people together as never before and introduce them to the one god they worship."
 obj_christian_convert_desc:1 "Change state religion to Lutheran, Calvinist, or Anglican religion."
 EVTDESC3012:0 "As the Reformation is beginning to take a hold of Europe, drastic measures have been taken to try to stem the tide of its spread. The religious policies of the non-Roman Catholics are despised by the state and the oppression towards the various Protestant movements will probably lead to religious revolution within a short period of time if not handled properly."
 EVTDESC6165:0 "As we are an enlightened and tolerant society, some of our citizens have decided that the Catholic faith does not fit in with their current lifestyle choice and have decided instead to embrace Lutheranism."
 EVTDESC6174:0 "Senior Elders in our church have expressed the opinion that the recent mass conversion to Lutheranism was yet another sign of our Lord's divine wrath. Slightly more skeptical government officials think that our policy of tolerance may be a more likely cause."
 EVTNAME6405:0 "Lutheran Faith?"
 EVTDESC6405:0 "Ever since we fell under western influences, there have been those that suggest that we should embrace the Lutheran religion of the west as well."
 EVTOPTA6405:0 "This Lutheran religion sounds quite good."
 EVTDESC2008:0 "Thoughts of disapproval against the Roman Catholic Church are spreading across Europe as a result of the increasing corruption of monks and clerics. Voices are raised questioning the current principles and greed of the Church. $COUNTRY$, which was recently swayed by these so called heresies, has now openly broken with Rome and declared itself Lutheran."
 EVTDESC2009:0 "The Protestant Reformation is spreading like wildfire across Europe. Several different movements have already formed, proposing alternative ways of reforming the Christian faith that do not entirely follow Luther's doctrines. The so called Calvinist school of thought, named after preacher and reformed John Calvin, has come to dominate $COUNTRY$. Now, $MONARCH$ has decided to renounce Catholicism and Lutheranism alike and adopt this new Reformed type of Christianity."
 HINT_RELIGION_TEXT:0 "A major cause of division, other than cultural differences, are religious differences. A Catholic country, for example, will consider other countries that are Lutheran, Calvinist, Waldensian, Orthodox, Oriental or Nestorian as heretics, while it would consider other religions to be heathens. All the provinces in your country affect your Religious Unity. You can convert provinces to your religion with a Missionary."
 HINT_REFORMDESIRE_TEXT:0 "Reform Desire represents how much pressure there is within Catholicism to reform the faith. High Reform Desire will eventually unlock the Reformation, allowing Catholic countries and provinces to convert into Lutheranism or Calvinism Faiths. Reform Desire is usually increased by random events and is global for the whole Catholic religion, not just your country."

 trade_league.14.d:0 "A papal envoy expresses concern for the religious unity of the League, with protestant sentiments running unchecked among members. He suggests letting the church send a religious advisor to oversee and report on the spiritual state of the League."
 colonial.EVTDESC21:0 "These so called pilgrims from [Root.Owner.ColonialParent.GetName] are following the Lutheran faith, which is an abomination to the [Root.Owner.ColonialParent.GetAdjective] [Root.Owner.ColonialParent.Religion.GetName] church. In the hopes of finding a more tolerant society in the New World, they have settled in [Root.GetName]."
 religious_events.EVTDESC3:0 "Our tolerant religious policy seems to have led to unwanted results. It seems that some of our people have decided to embrace the Lutheran faith."
 swiss_tolerance_desc:0 "The Reformation threatens to tear our land apart. Some provinces have joined the Lutheran movement, others have adopted Calvinist practices, and still others remain Catholic. Our land is ravaged by violence and confusion. Why must we kill each other over transubstantiation and predestination when we could turn our mountain home into a realm united once more?"
 legacy_of_sword_brethren_desc:0 "The Duchy of Kurland is established on the lands of Schwertbrüderorden, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword. Our first duke was the Grandmaster and our nobility, the knights of the Order. The noble converted to Lutheranism and the Order secularized, but the Christian Knights' fortress stands firmly."

 #REFORMED -> CALVINIST
 reformed:0 "Calvinist"
 reformed_religion_desc:0 "Calvinism is a major branch of Protestantism that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice set down by John Calvin and other Reformation-era theologians such as Huldrych Zwingli and John Knox. Calvinists differ from Lutherans on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, theories of worship, and the use of God's law for believers, among other things, and they embrace a number of perceived more hard-line ideas such as predestination and iconoclasm and unlike Lutherans they generally do not form state Churches.\n In game Calvinism will begin appearing in the late 16th century as an offshoot of Catholicism and Lutheranism."
