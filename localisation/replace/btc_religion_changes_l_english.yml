 tengri_events.38.d:0 "Used to acting far away from the Patriarch of their church the Oriental Orthodox Monastic Orders have quickly made themselves at home in our lands. They are now growing in numbers and influence, especially in the frontier regions under our control.

Our Shamans are alarmed at this practice as they feel they should be the ones to welcome our new subjects rather than these foreign Monks."

Perhaps it is simply a religious matter, but what if they are attempting to gather allies against us? We would be beset on multiple fronts by fanatical infidels!"
