 btc_cir_flavor.1.t: "Adyghe Rugs"
 btc_cir_flavor.1.d: "Our people mastered the art of rug making a thousand years ago, and merchants from every corner of the known world have sought them out. Adorned with horses, birds, and other natural images of our homeland, our gold and silver rugs have become popular across much of eastern Europe and the Levant. The materials used in the making of these rugs are difficult to come by, however, as traditionalists suggest that the supplies used be collected only once a year during a particular season. With the advent of modern production techniques, we can vastly improve the rate at which we produce our rugs but we must forgo some of our more ancient rug making practices to do so."
 btc_cir_flavor.1.a: "Let us move past outdated methods and embrace a future of industry!"
 btc_cir_flavor.1.b: "Our ancient techniques have been honed over generations; we will never abandon them!"
 btc_cir_flavor.2.t: "The Crescent and the Bear"
 btc_cir_flavor.2.d: "The Sultans of the Ottoman Empire have finished their conquest of the southern Caucauses, and Great Russia looms down on our realm from the north. Stuck between two great powers, our nation's advisors grow nervous. Some suggest that we side openly with one of the nations, knowing full well that this would put us at odds with the other. The Ottomans are more than willing to accept new converts to the faith, and Russia's hunger for land could be directed elsewhere if we strengthen our ties to her. A third, more inflamatory option has also presented itself - deny both, and protest their claims on lands that rightfully belong to Circassia and her people. This would encourage both parties to act more agressively toward us in the future, but it would also show our people that Circassia does not need to bow before any foreign power."
 btc_cir_flavor.2.a: "The Ottomans are the more pressing threat; let us side with our brothers to the south."
 btc_cir_flavor.2.b: "Mighty Russia will protect us from the Turkish hordes; we will support Russia's claims."
 btc_cir_flavor.2.c: "Circassia needs no protector; we will not grovel at the feet of foreign invaders!"
 btc_cir_flavor.3.t: "The Italian and the Slave"
 btc_cir_flavor.3.d: "Our womenfolk are known abroad for their beauty and grace, a fact that has not escaped the notice of our Italian neighbors. Many know the tale of Cosimo de' Medici who, in the early 1400s, took one of our women as a mistress and sired a son through her.\n\nIt has been a regular habit to introduce our most beautiful girls to Italian men as slaves in exchange for preferred treatment and economic favoritism in the region. However some amongst our people question this practice, allegating that we should denounce this practice in full, knowing that our women are strong in their own right and cannot be traded as a commodity, since they are as much a part of the Circassian soul as Circassian men."
 btc_cir_flavor.3.a: "Continue the slave trade as is, we can't afford to lose these privileges."
 btc_cir_flavor.3.b: "Cut all trading ties regarding slaves! Our women belong among their own people."
