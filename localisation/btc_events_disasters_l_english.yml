Although poorly coordinated between our armies, Castile has thanked us for our participation in the reconquista and promises us monetary compensation for our efforts, and to immediately send their own troops in the area to prevent any form of uprisings. Given we are already stretched thin in our efforts to deter aggression from Muslims in North Africa, it would be very convenient for us if these provinces became Castile's headache instead..."

  btc_lc_cities.6.d: "The recent death of the Duke of Burgundy saw the Duchy of Flanders transfer to us.

  btc_lc_cities.7.t: "The Colonial Port of the Low Countries"
  btc_lc_cities.7.d: "The establishment of colonies in the New World and the East Indies have increased the demand for goods from Europe to be exported to the colonies, and the demand for metals and textiles among traders traveling the sea route to the Far East has increased. The establishment of trade routes to the Far East has also brought unseen numbers of eastern goods and spices that previously had to take the land route through Germany. Hundreds of ships would pass through daily, and up to 2,000 carts would enter the city each week. Antwerp would soon grown to the second-largest European city north of the Alps."

  btc_lc_cities.9.t: "Portuguese Trade"
  btc_lc_cities.9.d: "With the discovery of the East Indies, the demand for metals and textiles for trade among Portuguese traders rose. The port of Antwerp, situated on the Rhine, proved the most logical choice for a location to secure large amounts of European metals and textiles in exchange for goods from the East Indies. Antwerp soon became the trade hub for all Portuguese trade with mainland Europe, and the city soon expanded to include trade from Italy,England,France,Germany and Spain, with local workers processing the large amounts of raw supplies that traveled through the city."

The influence of merchants from other parts of the low countries led to large amounts of Baltic grain being imported through the Danish sound toll towards Amsterdam. Amsterdam grain merchants dominated the Baltic grain trade throughout the period, eventually declining from changes in the Baltic market."
  btc_lc_cities.10.a: "Import more grain!"

  btc_lc_cities.11.t: "The Center of the Dutch Golden Age"
  btc_lc_cities.11.d: "With the 80 years war raging on throughout the low countries, and the former capital of the United Provinces, Antwerp, occupied and sacked by the Spanish, the choice was made to relocated the capital to Amsterdam. Antwerp would be retaken a few times, and hostilities would eventually cease, but the Southern Provinces would remain under Spanish control, and the Dutch would limit trade towards the south. Amsterdam would receive large amounts of migrant dutch from the Southern Provinces, and replace Antwerp as the new trade capital of the region."

  btc_lc_cities.12.t: "The migration of the Dutch"
  btc_lc_cities.12.d: "The occupation of the low countries has led to large amounts of persecution among the heretical and heathen populace of the occupied provinces.

  btc_lc_cities.12.a: "They shall be welcome."

  btc_lc_cities.13.t: "Sack of Antwerp"
  btc_lc_cities.13.d: "With the trade capital of the United Provinces under our control, victory seems likely against the rebels. However, the distance between the low countries and our homeland has led to a slight delay in payments to the troops. Rumors have spread of the troops gathering forces to loot the city, and if their pay does not reach in-time, Antwerp may be reduced to ashes."
  btc_lc_cities.13.a: "Sack the city."
  btc_lc_cities.13.b: "Make an effort to pay the troops."

  flavor_ita.1.d: "As we are solidifying our claims on the Italian peninsula and striving to become the most important nation in the region, culturally and politically, the time has come to settle an issue many have brought up. Our peninsula has an extremely rich cultural tradition, with many notable works produced by poets, philosophers, scholars, kings and bishops, from Sicily to Piedmont. However, by far the most important centres of Italian cultures are in the middle of the peninsula: from Rome to Florence, with authors like Dante Alighieri or Niccolò Machiavelli, the cultural legacy of central Italy is unparalleled. Our nation however hails from the more distant $CAPITAL$, and we still proudly follow our [Root.Culture.GetName] traditions, as we should. However, some are suggesting that by switching over to the more renowned Tuscan language, we could more easily spread and adapt it to the rest of the Italian people that are coming under our rule, to better harmonize our state apparatus with their own and to become the representatives and true heirs of the cultural legacy of central Italy. Whilst this may cause unhappiness among certain circles back at home, the benefits will likely outweigh the cost. What shall we do?"

  PriceChangesBTC.1.desc:0 "Europe is experiencing an increased interest in the revival of Classical Antiquity art. Artists are looking upon creating expressive, dynamic and beautiful figures made of marble stone. A quarry in Massa, producer of a famous high-quality marble since ancient Roman times known as Luni Marble, has recently seen a huge increase in demand for the endless new projects on statuary and architecture. There seems no end in artists coming and ordering stone. Marble is now pink gold."

Following the bigger importance of the city in a regional level and the increasing demand of the famous Luni Marble of Carrara for renaissance art and building projects, the family created the "Office of Marble" in 1564 to regulate the marble mining industry. Despite the cradle of anarchism Carrara became centuries among the quarry workers, these new regulations and prices seem to be working, and the cost of high-quality marble will only increase for the foreseeable future."

Following the religious turmoil of the 16th century, darker religious themes and styles were emphatised once again like the chiaroscuro, or light dark. Although breath-taking sculptures are still being made and renaissance architecture is still notable, this wonderful art is decaying again to give birth to new, more dramatic and exaggerated expressions of art, such as mannerism, to represent a ravaged by war and religiously divided society."

  #Whaling event.
  PriceChangesBTC.4.t: "Increased Whaling in the Western Seas"
  PriceChangesBTC.4.d: "Beginning in the 14th century, the whalers of northern Spain and southern France began expanding their fisheries and undertook 'seasonal trips' to the English Channel and southern Ireland. While the Basque controlled most whaling operations at the time, the lucrative market soon piqued the interest of European powers, with the English, Scandinavians and Dutch beginning to establish several whaling stations in the northern islands of Europe. These were set up in Britain, Norway, Iceland and several other places. The beginning of the age of exploration in the 15th and 16th centuries marked a significant increase in whaling activities as the newly discovered islands in the west became important whaling stations. The fisheries spread to Terranova (Labrador and Newfoundland) in the second quarter of the 16th century, where important stations were established at Red Bay and in Greenland. At this time England, France, the United Provinces and later Denmark-Norway shipped expert Basque whalemen for their expeditions. At that point, Basque whaling relied on the utilization of stations ashore where blubber could be processed into oil. Eventually the European powers would found their own whaling companies, resulting in conflict over fishing rights and a further expansion of whaling operations with the subsequent discovery of islands in the southern Atlantic sea."

  #Apiculture event
  PriceChangesBTC.5.t: "Invention of the movable-comb hive"
  PriceChangesBTC.5.d: "Apiculture had always been an important market, considered a vital tradition to many cultures. During the medieval period abbeys and monasteries were centers of beekeeping, since beeswax was highly prized for candles and fermented honey was used to make alcoholic mead in areas of Europe where vines would not grow.\n\nHowever, it was not until the 18th century that European natural philosophers undertook the scientific study of bee colonies and began to understand the complex and hidden world of bee biology. From microscopes and dissection to understand internal biology of honey bees, to glass walled observation hives, to proving how bee queens are inseminated. The advances in bee-science were many and relevant, with François Huber being universally regarded as "the father of modern bee-science", thanks to his book "Nouvelles Observations sur Les Abeilles (or "New Observations on Bees"), which revealed all the basic scientific truths for the biology and ecology of honeybees.\n\nCollecting honey was a rudimentary and unhygienic process, which entailed the destruction of the entire colony when the honey was harvested, making it inefficient despite its lucrative market. Thanks to these scientific advances in bee biology, the 18th and 19th centuries saw successive stages of a revolution in beekeeping, which allowed the bees themselves to be preserved when taking the harvest.\n\nForeshadowed by Thomas Wildman in his 1768 book 'A Treatise on the Management of Bees', this gatekeeping practice revolution saw its completion in the 19th century by the American Lorenzo Lorraine, the first person to make practical use of Huber's earlier discoveries to create the movable-comb hive. The invention and development of the movable-comb-hive fostered the growth of commercial honey production on a large scale in both Europe and the US."

  btc_tradegoods.2.d: "In the 16th century as a result of the Columbian Exchange, several new plants were introduced to Europe, chiefly among them was the potato. The staple was subsequently conveyed by European mariners to territories and ports throughout the world. For the Europeans the potato was regarded as a food for the natives and many thought it was poisonous: the conquistadors speak most favourably of the potato but they recommend it especially for the natives who have to do the heaviest jobs. A similar pattern is to be found in England where the potato became be the food of the working class. Thus, the potato was slow to be adopted by European farmers, but soon enough it became an important food staple and field crop that played a major role in the European 19th century population boom."

  btc_misc.3.t: "Dirk Martens and John of Westphalia"
  btc_misc.3.d: "Dirk Martens and John of Westphalia were two early renaissance Flemish editors, printers and authors born in Aalst and Paderborn, respectively. Both scholars and related to prominent families, Martens was educated in the Aalst monastery of Hermits of Saint William whilst John studied in the University of Cologne.\n\nThey probably met in Venice around 1471, where Martens worked with another Flemish scholar, the humanist Gerardus de Lisa, from Ghent. It was then when Martens learnt the art of printing. The two decided to start a venture together and traveled back to Aalst, starting what would become the first printing press in the Southern Netherlands.\n\nAlthough the partnership ended in 1474 when Johan moved to Leuven to start his own printing press, Martens' printing press flourished and became an important publisher and editor, publishing books of many important figures of the time, such as books by Christopher Columbus, over 50 books by Erasmus, the very first edition of Thomas More's 'Utopia' and printing Enea Piccolomini's book, who later became Pope Pius II. Martens was also the first person to print Greek and Hebrew characters in the Netherlands.\n\nUpon John's death in 1498, Martens bought his shop and settled in Leuven, where he remained for the remanining of his professional career except for a decade he spent in Antwerp. In 1529 he moved back to Aalst where he died on 1534, around 88 years old.\n\nWhile there are other contenders for the title, he is often considered to be the first printer in Flanders and the importance of his work, especially his publications in Antwerp and Leuven, his role in the humanistic movement, and his contributions to the study of Greek and Hebrew, has been compared to the role Christoffel Plantijn played in Antwerp at the end of the 16th century."

From a young age, Hayreddin and his 3 brothers became seamen, engaged in marine affairs and international trade. Initially working as sailors, they then turned privateers in the Mediterranean to counteract Knights Hospitaller influence, who were based on the island of Rhodes at the moment.\n\nHayreddin career continued under his older brother Oruç, mainly in the western Mediterranean, after Oruç moved to the Tunisian island of Djerba and made it his base. Their involvement in helping the Muslim Mudéjars flee from Spain to North Africa increased their fame, with his brother Oruç earning the honorific name Baba Oruç (Father Oruç), which eventually – due to similarity in sound – evolved in the Christian Meditarranean as Barbarossa.\n\nAfter dozens of impressive feats like capturing 23 enemy ships in less than a month, conquering Algiers from the Spanish or seizing several castles around Christian coasts, Barbarossa started working closely with the Ottoman Sultans in order to protect his rule over Algiers from the Spanish.\n\nA prominent figure for sure in our nation's affairs, his presence can't be overlooked and our court is wondering whether we want to promote Barbarossa to a higher office, ensuring Ottoman supremacy in the Mediterranean."

As our economic situation still hasn't fully stabilized however, we may want to consider alternative ways of paying them back. As the exploration of the New World continues, we could grant them some land in the area of Venezuela that is currently under exploration. This area is suspected of containing gold mines which would be very valuable if discovered, and granting the Welsers rights over the colony would in essence make them look for the gold for us, and open up lucrative trade opportunities and potentially establish even better relations between ourselves and the Empire. Should things turn out not to be beneficiary for us, we can always remind them of who really owns the New World..."

[From.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] is willing to grant us rights over the lands of Venezuela in the New World, lands known to be filled with gold mines in the interior. Although we are completely unfamiliar with the New World, this is an opportunity to obtain untold riches that we ought to consider, especially because the area is rumored to contain the legendary El Dorado, the City of Gold. The contract [From.Monarch.GetName] is proposing obligates us to conquer the country at our own expenses, search for El Dorado in [From.Monarch.GetName]'s name, enlist only Spanish and Imperial troops, fit out two expeditions of four vessels, and build two cities and three forts within two years after taking possession.

  #Edict of Moulins

  edict_moulins.1.d:0 "Since the middle ages, France has divided her territory through 'appanages'; a series of titles, offices, estates or other things of value granted to the younger males of the ruling family, known as princes, who would otherwise have no inheritance under the system of primogeniture, where the firstborn inherits his parent's entire estate.\n\nMany problems arise from this system with provinces becoming highly autonomous or de facto independent, some of them becoming very powerful on their own and even waging war against France or openly allying France's enemies. One example of this is the case of the duchy of Burgundy, title ceded by Henry I to his brother Robert I. Many french kings, like Charles V, tried to remove the appanage system and hold a tighter grip in their domains, but in vain.\n\nIn 1566 an important royal ordinance was issued in Moulins under Charles IX, receiving the name of the Edict of Moulins. This ordinance dealt with many aspects of the administration of justice and feudal and ecclesiastical privilege, abrogation of the levy of rights of tallage claimed by seigneurs over their dependants and provisions for a system of concessions on rivers. This edict also declared that the royal domain could not be alienated except in a couple exceptional cases, such as the creation of an appanage, which must return to the crown in its original state on the extinction of the male line. Therefore the apanagist could not separate himself from his appanage in any way.\n\nWhile this medieval system was not completely removed until the french revolution in the late 18th century, this edict greatly changed the influence French monarchs had in their domains and reduced the princes' influence over the royal domain considerably."

  btc_roman_inquisition.1.d: "The rapid spread of Protestantism in Europe has not gone unnoticed by the Holy See. Determined to stop the spread of such heretical beliefs in Italy, Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has decreed the establishment of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition, in order to shield Catholicism in the peninsula, echoing the Medieval Inquisitions of ages past that put down the Cathars and Waldensians. As several attempts to convince European monarchs of the dangers of these new heretical beliefs have failed, the Church believes this new bureaucratic, rather than military, approach will be effective in outright preventing the spread of such ideas in the Papal States. Already many people have been questioned and imprisoned over Protestantism, sorcery, immorality, blasphemy, Judaizing and witchcraft, and many books deemed heretical have been censored and destroyed. While this office will certainly hinder any attempts of Protestant theologians to spread their ideas to Italy it remains to be seen if this will result in any meaningful contributions to stopping the spread of the Reformation in Europe as a whole."
