 sengoku_spearmanDESCR:0 "Attempts were made in Japan by Emperor Tenmu in the 7th century to have a conscripted national army, but this did not come about, and by the 10th century Japan instead relied on individual landowners to provide men for conflicts and wars. These horse-owning landowners were the beginnings of the samurai class and the men who worked the land for the landowners became the common foot soldiers during times of war.\n\nThese wandering foot soldiers eventually became the ashigaru, commonly armed with naginata, yari, yumi or swords. With the further development of campaign strategies on a grand scale during 15th and 16th centuries composition of the army changed, with masses of ashigaru being sent to war by their lords.\n\nThese ashigaru are armed with yari (Japanese longspear) for use in close combat or to make an almost-impenetrable defence against cavalry."

 late_sengoku_monk:0 "Ikko-ikki Sohei" #9
 late_sengoku_monkDESCR:0 "Sohei were Buddhist warrior monks of both medieval and feudal Japan. At certain points in history, they held considerable power, obliging the imperial and military governments to collaborate. The prominence of the sohei rose in parallel with the ascendancy of the Tendai school's influence between the 10th and 17th centuries. The warriors protected land and intimidated rival schools of Buddhism, becoming a significant factor in the spread of Buddhism and the development of different schools during the Kamakura period (1185-1333).\n\nSohei were quite varied in their armament. The naginata is the weapon most often associated with them, though many warrior monks are known to have been proficient with everything from bow to tanto and wakizashi (dagger and short sword). Many fought on horseback, and many with the o-yoroi armor of the samurai.\n\nThese Sohei are Ikko-ikki, countryside mobs far more varied in their armor and armament that rose in rebellion against several Daimyos during 15th-16th centuries."

Not widely used at first, by the 1560s thousands of gunpowder weapons were in use in Japan, and began to have revolutionary effects upon Japanese tactics, strategy, army compositions, and castle architecture"

 edo_samurai_arquebusier:0 "Arquebus Samurai" #12
 edo_samurai_arquebusierDESCR:0 "The majority of arquebusses were used by ashigaru troops. The guns were reasonably simple to use and arming the ashigaru with them was quicker and cheaper than training archers. It also freed up the samurai to participate in combat using weapons that required more skill, such as the katana or bow. However due to how highly inaccurate first matchlock arquebusses were and how long they took to reload, many samurai started a more professional training in the use of firearms and were expected to use their better skills to be much more accurate in their fire, focusing on taking out single, important enemies rather than completely rely on volleys like the ashigaru."

 mid_edo_musket_samuraiDESCR:0 "Especialized samurai highly trained in the use of firearms. Due to the intensity of their training in the use of arquebusses, their skill with close range weapons is not as effective as a traditional samurai's, making them a dependent but highly effective troop."

 mid_edo_ashigaru_mass_infantryDESCR:0 "By the late 16th century, Japan already overtook every single European country in total firearms produced. The Japanese were so enthusiastic with the newly adopted type of weapon that in 1592, during the Japanese invasion of Korea, at least a quarter of the invasion force of 160.000 were gunners. Extremely successful at the use of firearms, the Japanese managed to capture Seoul just 18 days after their landing at Busan.\n\nEach of these regiments consist of a thousand solid ashigaru gunners."
 mid_edo_yari_cavalry:0 "Reformed Samurai Cavalry" #17
 mid_edo_yari_cavalryDESCR:0 "With the quick widespread of firearms, cavalry began to gain more importance as a charge and chase unit rather than a formalized traditional force with sword or bow. Samurai had to adapt to the new rules of warfare and cavalry slowly shifted to carrying the yari (Japanese longspear) to facilitate this new purpose.

 yabusame_samurai_cavalry:0 "Mounted Yabusame Samurai" #23
 yabusame_samurai_cavalryDESCR:0 "Yabusame is a type of mounted archery in traditional Japanese archery. An archer trained in Yabusame could fire on a running horse three special "turnip-headed" arrows successively at three wooden targets. Minamoto no Yoritomo, first Shogun of the Kamakura Shogunate (1185-1333) became alarmed at the lack of archery skills his samurai had and organized yabusame as a form of practice.\n\nWith the arrival of the Portuguese and their guns in the mid-16th century, the bow began to lose its importance on the battlefield. However, mounted archery was revived in the Edo period (1600–1867) by Ogasawara Heibei Tsuneharu, a general under the shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune during late 17th-early 18th centuries."

 tokugawa_musketeerDESCR:0 "In the late 16th century, after an intense internal war for the unification of the country, the Oda clan, lead by Oda Nobunaga, succesfully gained control over most of Honshu (Japanese archipelago's main island). After Nobunaga's sudden death by a retainer of his in a rebellion, a member of the Toyotomi clan, Toyotomi Hideyori, succeded him. Failing to strenghten the new government's position due to a series of failures and military defeats such as the failed invasion of Korea in 1598, the Tokugawa clan led by Tokugawa Ieyasu rebelled in arms and after a 3 year intense war, he succesfully gained control of the entire country.\n\nAn almost 3 centuries long Shogunate government was established and strong isolationist policies were introduced, forcing internal peace and securing stability and prosperity. During these almost 3 centuries, Japan did not have any large scale confrontation and arms weren't used outside keeping peace by authorities and a farm implement to scare animals. But rather than decreasing the production of guns, there were around 200 gunsmiths by the end of the Edo period, maintaining a sizeable and strong army for the Shogunate."
 rifle_samurai_cavalry:0 "Westernized Rifle Cavalry" #28
 rifle_samurai_cavalryDESCR:0 "Despite the Tokugawa Shogunate's isolationist policies, known as Sakoku, a body of knowledge named Rangaku developed in Japan through its contacts with the Dutch in the trading post of Dejima in Nagasaki. This "Western learning" allowed Japan to keep abreast of Western technology and medicine during the Saikoku period (1641-1853).\n\nA lot of Japanese learned many aspects of the scientific and technological revolution occurring in Europe at that time in a diverse number of knowledge bodies such as medicine, physics, electricity, chemistry, mechanical sciences, biology or geography. This allowed at the start of the 19th century to the inclusion of new, more advanced fireams into the country such as flintlock rifles and bigger artillery. Japan soon started to develop their own home-made versions with notable examples such as airguns, developed by Kunitomo Ikkansai and experiments on flintlock mechanisms.\n\nThese mounted samurai were equiped with rifles, though still fairly inaccurate for a cavalry unit, they were relatively succesful and a force to be reckoned."
 green_army_japanese_cavalry:0 "Defected Green Standard Army" #28
 green_army_japanese_cavalryDESCR:0 "The Green Standard Army was the name of a category of military units under the control of Qing dynasty China. It was made up mostly of ethnic Han soldiers and operated concurrently with the Manchu-Mongol-Han Eight Banner armies.\n\nThe original Green Standard troops were the soldiers of the Ming commanders who surrendered to the Qing in 1644 and after. Their troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service; they usually came from the socially disadvantaged, and remained segregated from Chinese society, partly because of the latter's deep anti-military bias during the late Ming period, and partly because they were paid too poorly and irregularly to marry and support a family.\n\nMany of these defected Ming troops moved to Japan during war time through the active port of Nagasaki where Tokugawa shogunate traded with China, though majority of ethnic Han soldiers were loyal to Qing."
