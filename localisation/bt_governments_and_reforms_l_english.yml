 puppet_kingdom_of_ireland_legacy:0 "Subject Viceroyalty"
 puppet_kingdom_of_ireland_legacy_desc:0 "A Viceroyalty is typically a subordinate government ruled by proxy. A representative of the parent government safeguards the interests of the parent nation, and the transplanted elite from the parent nation often occupy the majority of government offices while the local poulation is often given little representation. Governments of this type are highly unpopular, but few can object to their productivity and tax collection. Well, few outside of those paying those taxes..."
 transitional_government_ireland_legacy:0 "Transitional Government"
 transitional_government_ireland_legacy_desc:0 "A transitional government fulfills administrative duties in a society in transition, often a nation recently independent from a foreign power, or a nation in the throws of a revolution. While this government may be all that stands between the country and pure anarchy, it is rarely much better than anarchy. Warlords and oligarchs vie for positions of power in the new society, patriots and revolutionaries scheme to take the country in a new direction, while loyalists and conservatives try to return the country to its former structure. Thankfully, this chaos most often proves very temporary, as one faction or another usually wins out within a few years and the nation returns to a more stable form of government."

 #Government Reforms
 tanistry_reform:0 "Tanistry"
 tanistry_reform_desc:0 "Tanistry is the traditional inheritance system of Ireland and Britain. Under this system, a Tanist is elected by popular vote of the Dearbhfhine, or the decendants of a previous king up to four generations back, from the available Righdamhna, or kingly material, who are Dearbhfhine of the age of majority and without any physical or mental deformity. Unlike most primogeniture succession laws on the continent, it is common for a brother, uncle, or nephew to be first in line to inheirit, and also unlike most elective monarchy laws on the continent, only the direct descendants of previously ruling kings were eligible. This system is highly stable and typically ensures a compentent king is chosen, but it also occasionally causes civil wars between cousins."
 irish_clann_reform:0 "Clann"
 irish_clann_reform_desc:0 "Clanns were the primary local political and social unit in Gaelic Ireland. The hereditary system was highly stable, but its power structures were exceptionally weak and decentralized for the 15th century and its largely rural population quickly becoming unable to compete in a modernising Europe."
 provincial_kingdom_reform:0 "Provincial Kingdom"
 provincial_kingdom_reform_desc:0 "Ríthe Ruireach, or Overkings (also often call Ríthe Cúige, or Provincial Kings), were influential local kings, exercising their power over one of the ancient provinces of Ireland. Historically second only to the High King, and indeed being the candidates from which most High Kings were chosen, these local kings were some of the most powerful men in Gaelic Ireland. Despite their influence, however, they often lacked the power structures and centralisation of larger European states, though not to the extent of the local Clann chiefs."
 norman_lordship_reform:0 "Norman Lordship"
 norman_lordship_reform_desc:0 "Norman Lordships are positions created by Anglo-Norman powers following the Norman conquest of Ireland in 1172, into which they installed loyal Anglo-Norman lords as a reward for miltary service as well as to ensure continued control over Ireland. Nominally vassals of the English monarch, these lordships were de facto independent by the 15th century, and shared far more with their Gaelic neighbours than their distant English cousins."
 anglo_irish_monarchy_reform:0 "Anglo-Irish Monarchy"
 anglo_irish_monarchy_reform_desc:0 "A form of constitutional or representative monarchy based on the English parliamentary tradition of Westminster, with a parliament called regularly by the ruling monarch. It is based on the privileges defined in Magna Carta and adapted to the local economy."
 puppet_kingdom_reform:0 "Viceroyalty"
