The semi-precious stone is so abundant that despite being collected since distant antiquity, production continued to increase to the point that by the 18th century, it is believe that 95% of all finshed amber produced worldwide originated from this region."
 bt_super_cows:0 "Friesian Cattle"

 bt_kornhaus_der_hansa:0 "Granary of the North"
 desc_bt_kornhaus_der_hansa:0 "Grain is not particularly abundant around the Baltic Sea. Temperatures are generally too cold and the ground too sandy or rocky to sustain more than modest crops of rye in many places, so any fertile soil producing reliably large yields of grain becomes particularly important. The countryside around Danzig is unusually fertile, and its position near the mouth of the Vistula positions it ideal to import grain from further upstream, as well. This combination slowly tranformed Danzig into a major grain port in the late Middle Ages, and eventually it came to be known as 'der Kornhaus der Hansa' (the granary of the Hanseatic League). A large share of Northern Europe's staple grain was either grown here, or at least passed through."
 bt_wines_of_bordeaux:0 "Claret of Bordeaux"
 desc_bt_wines_of_bordeaux:0 "Winemaking was first introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, but it wasn't until the marriage of Henry Plantagenet and Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1089 that wine production began in earnest. Following the marriage, the Aquitaine region suddenly found itself within the sprawling Angevin Empire, which had a strong taste for quality wine but little other land suitable for intensive viticulture. As a result, the industry was heavily developed and by the mid 1100s Bordeaux was already exporting vast quantities of wine, most commonly a rosé known as 'claret', to northwestern Europe."

 desc_bt_basque_whaling:0 "The Basque were the first in the world to hunt whales commercially, and the most successful by far until the 18th century. The burgeoning industry was centered primaily along the Basque coast, especially around San Sebastián, which was first granted whaling rights in 1150.

 bt_mercury_of_almaden:0 "Mines of Almadén"
 desc_bt_mercury_of_almaden:0 "Almadén is home to the world's largest reserves of cinnabar and mercury.

 curonian_strait_toll:0 "Curonian Strait Toll"
 desc_curonian_strait_toll:0 "The Curonian Lagoon is seperated from the rest of the Baltic Sea by a narrow strip of land called the Curonian Spit, creating a natural chokepoint at the only exit for the many cities and towns along the lagoon. Just some couple hundred metres wide, gaining control of this natural chokepoint will ensure our continued relevance in regional trade."
