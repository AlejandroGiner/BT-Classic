 *Reasoning is flavor and historical accuracy to represent local tribes.
 **Reasoning is being politically and geographically isolated from the rest of Africa making it not that important/profitable as Trade charter. Also to better represent 1.28 pirates.
 ***Reasoning is to represent local port/harbor.
 Reasoning behind all terrain changes is to make terrain more meaningful and accurate without breaking the line between accuracy and game balance. 
 Mountains now represent much more important defensive lines but also are harder and more expensive to build forts on. Building modifiers added merely as a counter-balance to forts being more powerful now.
