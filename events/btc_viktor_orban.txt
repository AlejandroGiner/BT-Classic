#Orban engineer (?-1453) event chain for Byzantium and Ottomans. He first proposes his services to Byzantine emperor, but AI will rarely accept - because price to hire
#is high. If declined, similar event happens to the Ottomans, who will always accept, no matter the funds.
#Gives an arty stack to respective country and some bonus to sieging, since such superguns weren't common and should have the special feeling of having bigass cannon (my dick)
#based on Cristopher columbus event chain from flavor_por and flavor_spa
